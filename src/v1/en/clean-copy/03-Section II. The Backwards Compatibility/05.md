### [Weak Coupling][back-compat-weak-coupling]

In the previous chapter, we've demonstrated how breaking strong coupling of components leads to decomposing entities and collapsing their public interfaces down to a reasonable minimum. But let us return to the question we have previously mentioned in the [“Extending through Abstracting”](#back-compat-abstracting-extending) chapter: how should we parametrize the order preparation process implemented via a third-party API? In other words, what *is* the `order_execution_endpoint` required in the API type registration handler?

```
PUT /v1/api-types/{api_type}
{
  …
  "order_execution_endpoint": {
    // ???
  }
}
```

Out of general considerations, we may assume that every such API would be capable of executing three functions: run a program with specified parameters, return the current execution status, and finish (cancel) the order. An obvious way to provide the common interface is to require these three functions to be executed via a remote call, let's say, like this:

```
PUT /v1/api-types/{api_type}
{
  …
  "order_execution_endpoint": {
    "program_run_endpoint": {
      /* Some description of
          the remote function call */
      "type": "rpc",
      "endpoint": <URL>,
      "parameters"
    },
    "program_get_state_endpoint",
    "program_cancel_endpoint"
  }
}
```

**NB**: by doing so, we transfer the complexity of developing the API onto the plane of developing appropriate data formats, i.e., developing formats for order parameters to the `program_run_endpoint`, and what format the `program_get_state_endpoint` shall return, etc., but in this chapter, we're focusing on different questions.

Though this API looks absolutely universal, it's quite easy to demonstrate how once simple and clear API ends up being confusing and convoluted. This design presents two main problems:

  1. It describes nicely the integrations we've already implemented (it costs almost nothing to support the API types we already know) but brings no flexibility to the approach. In fact, we simply described what we'd already learned, not even trying to look at the larger picture.
  2. This design is ultimately based on a single principle: every order preparation might be codified with these three imperative commands.

We may easily disprove the \#2 statement, and that will uncover the implications of the \#1. For the beginning, let us imagine that on a course of further service growth, we decided to allow end-users to change the order after the execution started. For example, request a contactless takeout. That would lead us to the creation of a new endpoint, let's say, `program_modify_endpoint`, and new difficulties in data format development (as new fields for contactless delivery requested and satisfied flags need to be passed both directions). What *is* important is that both the endpoint and the new data fields would be optional because of the backwards compatibility requirement.

Now let's try to imagine a real-world example that doesn't fit into our “three imperatives to rule them all” picture. That's quite easy as well: what if we're plugging not a coffee house, but a vending machine via our API? From one side, it means that the `modify` endpoint and all related stuff are simply meaningless: the contactless takeout requirement means nothing to a vending machine. On the other side, the machine, unlike the people-operated café, requires *takeout approval*: the end-user places an order while being somewhere in some other place then walks to the machine and pushes the “get the order” button in the app. We might, of course, require the user to stand up in front of the machine when placing an order, but that would contradict the entire product concept of users selecting and ordering beverages and then walking to the takeout point.

Programmable takeout approval requires one more endpoint, let's say, `program_takeout_endpoint`. And so we've lost our way in a forest of five endpoints:
  * to have vending machines integrated a partner must implement the `program_takeout_endpoint`, but doesn't need the `program_modify_endpoint`;
  * to have regular coffee houses integrated a partner must implement the `program_modify_endpoint`, but doesn't need the `program_takeout_endpoint`.

Furthermore, we have to describe both endpoints in the docs. It's quite natural that the `takeout` endpoint is very specific; unlike requesting contactless delivery, which we hid under the pretty general `modify` endpoint, operations like takeout approval will require introducing a new unique method every time. After several iterations, we would have a scrapyard, full of similarly looking methods, mostly optional — but developers would need to study the docs nonetheless to understand, which methods are needed in your specific situation, and which are not.

**NB**: in this example, we assumed that passing `program_takeout_endpoint` parameter is the flag to the application to display the “get the order” button; it would be better to add something like a `supported_flow` field to the `PUT /api-types/` endpoint to provide an explicit flag instead of this implicit convention; however, this wouldn't change the problematics of stockpiling optional methods in the interface, so we skipped it to keep examples laconic.

We actually don't know, whether in the real world of coffee machine APIs this problem will occur or not. But we can say with all confidence regarding “bare metal” integrations that the processes we described *always* happen. The underlying technology shifts; an API that seemed clear and straightforward, becomes a trash bin full of legacy methods, half of which borrows no practical sense under any specific set of conditions. If we add technical progress to the situation, e.g., imagine that after a while all coffee houses have become automated, we will finally end up with the situation with half of the methods *aren't actually needed at all*, like requesting a contactless takeout one.

It is also worth mentioning that we unwittingly violated the abstraction levels isolation principle. At the vending machine API level, there is no such thing as a “contactless takeout,” that's actually a product concept.

So, how would we tackle this issue? Using one of two possible approaches: either thoroughly study the entire subject area and its upcoming improvements for at least several years ahead, or abandon strong coupling in favor of a weak one. How would the *ideal* solution look to both parties? Something like this:
  * the higher-level program API level doesn't actually know how the execution of its commands works; it formulates the tasks at its own level of understanding: brew this recipe, send user's requests to a partner, allow the user to collect their order;
  * the underlying program execution API level doesn't care what other same-level implementations exist; it just interprets those parts of the task that make sense to it.

If we take a look at the principles described in the previous chapter, we would find that this principle was already formulated: we need to describe *informational contexts* at every abstraction level and design a mechanism to translate them between levels. Furthermore, in a more general sense, we formulated it as early as in “The Data Flow” paragraph of the [“Separating Abstraction Levels”](#api-design-separating-abstractions) chapter.

In our case we need to implement the following mechanisms:
  * running a program creates a corresponding context comprising all the essential parameters;
  * there is the information stream regarding the state modifications: the execution level may read the context, learn about all the changes and report back the changes of its own.

There are different techniques to organize this data flow, but, basically, we always have two contexts and a two-way data pipe in between. If we were developing an SDK, we would express the idea with emitting and listening events, like this:

```
/* Partner's implementation of the program
   run procedure for a custom API type */
registerProgramRunHandler(
  apiType, 
  (program) => {
    // Initiating an execution
    // on partner's side
    let execution = initExecution(…);
    // Listen to parent context changes
    program.context.on(
      'takeout_requested', 
      () => {
        // If a takeout is requested, initiate
        // corresponding procedures
        await execution.prepareTakeout();
        // When the cup is ready for takeout,
        // emit corresponding event for 
        // a higher-level entity to catch it
        execution.context.emit('takeout_ready');
      }
    );
    program.context.on(
      'order_canceled',
      () => {
        await execution.cancel();
        execution.context.emit('canceled');
      }
    );
    
    return execution.context;
  }
);
```

**NB**: In the case of HTTP API, a corresponding example would look rather bulky as it would require implementing several additional endpoints for the message exchange like `GET /program-run/events` and `GET /partner/{id}/execution/events`. We would leave this exercise to the reader. Also, it's worth mentioning that in real-world systems such event queues are usually organized using external event messaging systems like Apache Kafka or Amazon SNS/SQS.

At this point, a mindful reader might begin protesting because if we take a look at the nomenclature of the new entities, we will find that nothing changed in the problem statement. It actually became even more complicated:
  * instead of calling the `takeout` method, we're now generating a pair of `takeout_requested` / `takeout_ready` events;
  * instead of a long list of methods that shall be implemented to integrate the partner's API, we now have a long list of context entities and events they generate;
  * and with regards to technological progress, we've changed nothing: now we have deprecated fields and events instead of deprecated methods.

And this remark is totally correct. Changing API formats doesn't solve any problems related to the evolution of functionality and underlying technology. Changing API formats serves another purpose: to make the code written by developers stay clean and maintainable. Why would strong-coupled integration (i.e. making entities interact via calling methods) render the code unreadable? Because both sides *are obliged* to implement the functionality which is meaningless in their corresponding subject areas. Code that integrates vending machines into the system *must* respond “ok” to the contactless delivery request — so after a while, these implementations would comprise a handful of methods that just always return `true` (or `false`).

The difference between strong coupling and weak coupling is that the field-event mechanism *isn't obligatory for both actors*. Let us remember what we sought to achieve:
  * a higher-level context doesn't know how low-level API works — and it really doesn't; it describes the changes that occur within the context itself, and reacts only to those events that mean something to it;
  * a low-level context doesn't know anything about alternative implementations — and it really doesn't; it handles only those events which mean something at its level and emits only those events that could happen under its specific conditions.

It's ultimately possible that both sides would know nothing about each other and wouldn't interact at all, and this might happen with the evolution of underlying technologies.

**NB**: in the real world this might not be the case, i.e., we might *want* the application to know, whether the takeout request was successfully served or not, i.e., listen to the `takeout_ready` event and require the `takeout_ready` flag in the state of the execution context. Still, the general possibility of *not caring* about the implementation details is a very powerful technique that makes the application code much less complex — of course, unless this knowledge is important to the user.

One more important feature of weak coupling is that it allows an entity to have several higher-level contexts. In typical subject areas, such a situation would look like an API design flaw, but in complex systems, with several system state-modifying agents present, such design patterns are not that rare. Specifically, you would likely face it while developing user-facing UI libraries. We will cover this issue in detail in the “SDK and UI Libraries” section of this book.

#### The Inversion of Responsibility

It becomes obvious from what was said above that two-way weak coupling means a significant increase in code complexity on both levels, which is often redundant. In many cases, two-way event linking might be replaced with one-way linking without significant loss of design quality. That means allowing a low-level entity to call higher-level methods directly instead of generating events. Let's alter our example:

```
/* Partner's implementation of program
   run procedure for a custom API type */
registerProgramRunHandler(
  apiType, 
  (program) => {
    // Initiating an execution
    // on partner's side
    let execution = initExecution(…);
    // Listen to parent context changes
    program.context.on(
      'takeout_requested', 
      () => {
        // If a takeout is requested, initiate
        // corresponding procedures
        await execution.prepareTakeout();
        /* When the order is ready 
           for takeout, signalize about that
           by calling the parent context 
           method, not with event emitting */
        // execution.context
        //   .emit('takeout_ready')
        program.context
          .set('takeout_ready');
        // Or even more rigidly
        // program.setTakeoutReady();
      }
    );
    /* Since we're modifying parent context
       instead of emitting events, we don't 
       actually need to return anything */
    // return execution.context;
  }
);
```

Again, this solution might look counter-intuitive, since we efficiently returned to strong coupling via strictly defined methods. But there is an important difference: we're bothering ourselves with weak coupling because we expect alternative implementations of the *lower* abstraction level to pop up. Situations with different realizations of *higher* abstraction levels emerging are, of course, possible, but quite rare. The tree of alternative implementations usually grows from root to leaves.

Another reason to justify this solution is that major changes occurring at different abstraction levels have different weights:
  * if the technical level is under change, that must not affect product qualities and the code written by partners;
  * if the product is changing, e.g., we start selling flight tickets instead of preparing coffee, there is literally no sense to preserve backwards compatibility at technical abstraction levels. Ironically, we may actually make our API sell tickets instead of brewing coffee without breaking backwards compatibility, but the partners' code will still become obsolete.
  
In conclusion, as higher-level APIs are evolving more slowly and much more consistently than low-level APIs, reverse strong coupling might often be acceptable or even desirable, at least from the price-quality ratio point of view.

**NB**: many contemporary frameworks explore a shared state approach, Redux being probably the most notable example. In the Redux paradigm, the code above would look like this:

```
program.context.on(
  'takeout_requested', 
  () => {
    await execution.prepareTakeout();
    // Instead of generating events
    // or calling higher-level methods,
    // an `execution` entity calls 
    // a global or quasi-global `dispatch`
    // callback to change a global state
    dispatch(takeoutReady());
  }
);
```

Let us note that this approach *in general* doesn't contradict the weak coupling principle, but violates another one — of abstraction levels isolation, and therefore isn't very well suited for writing branchy APIs with high hierarchy trees. In such systems, it's still possible to use a global or quasi-global state manager, but you need to implement event or method call propagation through the hierarchy, i.e., ensure that a low-level entity always interacts with its closest higher-level neighbors only, delegating the responsibility of calling high-level or global methods to them.

```
program.context.on(
  'takeout_requested', 
  () => {
    await execution.prepareTakeout();
    // Instead of calling the global
    // `dispatch` method,  an `execution`
    // entity invokes its superior's 
    // dispatch functionality
    program.context.dispatch(takeoutReady());
  }
);
```

```
// program.context.dispatch implementation
ProgramContext.dispatch = (action) => {
  // program.context calls its own
  // superior or global object
  // if there are no superiors
  globalContext.dispatch(
    // The action itself may and
    // must be reformulated
    // in appropriate terms
    this.generateAction(action)
  );
}
```

#### Delegate!

From what was said, one more important conclusion follows: doing a real job, i.e., implementing some concrete actions (making coffee, in our case) should be delegated to the lower levels of the abstraction hierarchy. If the upper levels try to prescribe some specific implementation algorithms, then (as we have demonstrated on the `order_execution_endpoint` example) we will soon face a situation of inconsistent methods and interaction protocols nomenclature, most of which have no specific meaning when we talk about some specific hardware context.

Contrariwise, applying the paradigm of concretizing the contexts at each new abstraction level, we will eventually fall into the bunny hole deep enough to have nothing to concretize: the context itself unambiguously matches the functionality we can programmatically control. And at that level, we must stop detailing contexts further, and just realize the algorithms needed. It's worth mentioning that the abstraction deepness for different underlying platforms might vary.

**NB**. In the [“Separating Abstraction Levels”](#api-design-separating-abstractions) chapter we have illustrated exactly this: when we speak about the first coffee machine API type, there is no need to extend the tree of abstractions further than running programs, but with the second API type, we need one more intermediary abstraction level, namely the runtimes API.
