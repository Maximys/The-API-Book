### [The API Contexts Pyramid][api-design-context-pyramid]

The approach we use to design APIs comprises four steps:
  * defining an application field
  * separating abstraction levels
  * isolating responsibility areas
  * describing final interfaces.

This four-step algorithm actually builds an API from top to bottom, from common requirements and use case scenarios down to a refined nomenclature of entities. In fact, moving this way will eventually conclude with a ready-to-use API, and that's why we value this approach highly.

It might seem that the most useful pieces of advice are given in the last chapter, but that's not true. The cost of a mistake made at certain levels differs. Fixing the naming is simple; revising the wrong understanding of what the API stands for is practically impossible.

**NB**. Here and throughout we will illustrate the API design concepts using a hypothetical example of an API allowing for ordering a cup of coffee in city cafes. Just in case: this example is totally synthetic. If we were to design such an API in the real world, it would probably have very little in common with our fictional example.
