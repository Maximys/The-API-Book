This book is written to share the expertise and describe the best practices in designing and developing APIs. In Section I, we'll discuss the API architecture as a concept: how to build the hierarchy properly, from high-level planning down to final interfaces. Section II is dedicated to expanding existing APIs in a backward-compatible manner. Finally, in Section III we will talk about the API as a product.",
