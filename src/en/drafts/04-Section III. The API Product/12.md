### Testing Environment

Let us now discuss providing possibility for developers to test a full API cycle automatically. In many subject areas, that's totally not that simple â€” for example, in our imaginative coffee-machine API. In the real life, a full happy path of an order, beginning from searching for relevant offers and ending with giving order feedback, takes minutes, maybe tens of of minutes. To test some edge cases (let's say, a user asking for a refund because of quality issue) will require making several dozens of steps. The problem becomes even worse if we remember that directly testing money-related scenarios, both explicit and implicit (like sending SMS) might be costly. To ease working with such APIs, a testing environment is needed, in which developers might check-run their code.
