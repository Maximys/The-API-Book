### [Conclusion][sdk-conclusion]

In the previous eight chapters, we aimed to convey two important observations:
  * Developing a high-quality UI library is a very complex engineering task.
  * This task cannot be mechanically reduced to auto-generating SDKs based on a specificationÂ or data model.

Looking back at what was written, we cannot confidently claim that we found the best examples and the clearest wording for such a complex subject area. However, we hope that we have helped make the reader's life and the lives of their users a bit easier.
