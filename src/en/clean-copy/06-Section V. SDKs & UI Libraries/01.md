### [On Terminology. An Overview of Technologies for UI Development][sdk-toc-technology-overview]

As we mentioned in the Introduction, the term “SDK” (which stands for “Software Development Kit”) lacks concrete meaning. The common understanding is that an SDK differs from an API as it provides both program interfaces and tools to work with them. This definition is hardly satisfactory as today any technology is likely to be provided with a bundled toolset.

However, there is a very specific narrow definition of an SDK: it is a client library that provides a high-level interface (usually a native one) to some underlying platform (such as a client-server API). Most often, we talk about libraries for mobile OSes or Web browsers that work on top of a general-purpose HTTP API.

Among such client SDKs, one case is of particular interest to us: those libraries that not only provide programmatic interfaces to work with an API but also offer ready-to-use visual components for developers. A classic example of such an SDK is the UI libraries provided by cartographical services. Since developing a map engine, especially a vector one, is a very complex task, maps API vendors provide both “wrappers” to their HTTP APIs (such as a search function) and visual components to work with geographical entities. The latter often include general-purpose elements (such as buttons, placemarks, context menus, etc.) that can be used independently from the main functionality of the API.

This Section will be dedicated to these two types of program toolkits:
  * Client “wrappers” that work with client-server APIs
  * Client libraries that contain visual components with which end users might interact.

To avoid being wordy, we will use the term “SDK” for the former and “UI libraries” for the latter.

**NB**: Strictly speaking, a UI library might either include a client-server API “wrapper” or not (i.e., just provide a “pure” API to some underlying system engine). In this Section, we will mostly talk about the first option as it is the most general case and the most challenging one in terms of API design. Most SDK development patterns we will discuss are also applicable to “pure” libraries.

#### Selecting a Framework for UI Component Development

As UI is a high-level abstraction built upon OS primitives, there are specialized visual component frameworks available for almost every platform. Choosing such a framework might be regretfully challenging. For instance, in the case of the Web platform, which is both low-level and highly popular, the number of competing technologies for SDK development is beyond imagination. We could mention the most popular ones today, including React[ref React](https://react.dev/), Angular[ref Angular](https://angular.io/), Svelte[ref Svelte](https://svelte.dev/), Vue.js[ref Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/), as well as those that maintain a strong presence like Bootstrap[ref Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) and Ember.[ref Ember](https://emberjs.com/) Among these technologies, React demonstrates the most widespread adoption, still measured in single-digit percentages.[ref How Many Websites Use React in 2023? (Usage Statistics)](https://increditools.com/react-usage-statistics/) At the same time, components written in “pure” JavaScript/CSS often receive criticism for being less convenient to use in these frameworks as each of them implements a rigid methodology. The situation with developing visual libraries for Windows is quite similar. The question of “which framework to choose for developing UI components for these platforms” regretfully has no simple answer. In fact, one will need to evaluate the markets and make decisions regarding each individual framework.

In the case of actual mobile platforms (and MacOS), the current state of affairs is more favorable as they are more homogeneous. However, a different problem arises: modern applications typically need to support several such platforms simultaneously, which leads to code (and API nomenclatures) duplication.

One potential solution could be using cross-platform mobile (React Native[ref React Native](https://reactnative.dev/), Flutter[ref Flutter](https://flutter.dev/), Xamarin[ref Xamarin](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/apps/xamarin), etc.) and desktop (JavaFX[ref JavaFX](https://openjfx.io/), QT[ref QT](https://www.qt.io/), etc.) frameworks, or specialized technologies for specific tasks (such as Unity[ref Unity](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/index.html) for game development). The inherent advantages of these technologies are faster code-writing and universalism (of both code and software engineers). The disadvantages are obvious as well: achieving maximum performance could be challenging, and many platform tools (such as debugging and profiling) will not work. As of today, we rather see a parity between these two approaches (several independent applications for each platform vs. one cross-platform application).
