### [Components of an HTTP Request and Their Semantics][http-api-requests-semantics]

Third import exercise we must conduct is to describe the format of HTTP request and response and explain basic concepts. Many of these might look obvious to the reader. However, the situation is that even the basic knowledge we require to move further is scattered across vast and fragmented documentation, making even experienced developers struggle with some nuances. Below, we will try to compile some structured overview sufficient to design HTTP APIs.

To describe semantics and formats, we will refer to brand new [RFC 9110](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110.html) that replaced non less than nine previous specifications dealing with different aspects of the technology. Still, a significant volume of additional functionality is nevertheless covered by separate standards. In particular, the HTTP caching principles are described in standalone [RFC 9111](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9111.html), whereas the popular `PATCH` method is omitted in the main RFC and is regulated by [RFC 5789](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5789.html).

An HTTP request stands for (1) applying a specific verb to a URL, stating (2) the protocol version, (3) additional meta-information in headers, and (4) optionally, some content (request body):

```
POST /v1/orders HTTP/1.1
Host: our-api-host.tld
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "coffee_machine_id": 123,
  "currency_code": "MNT",
  "price": "10.23",
  "recipe": "lungo",
  "offer_id": 321,
  "volume": "800ml"
}
```

An HTTP response to such a request will comprise (1) protocol version, (2) status code with a corresponding message, (3) response headers, and (4) optionally, response content (body):

```
HTTP/1.1 201 Created
Location: /v1/orders/123
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "id": 123
}
```

**NB**: in HTTP/2 (and future HTTP/3) instead of holistic text format, separate binary frames are used for headers and data. This doesn't affect the architectural concepts we will describe below. However, to avoid ambiguity we will give all examples in the HTTP/1.1 format. You may read about the HTTP/2 format in detail [here](https://hpbn.co/http2/).
