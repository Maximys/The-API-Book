### [Decomposing UI Components][sdk-decomposing]

Let's transition to a more substantive conversation and try to understand why the requirement to allow the replacement of a component's subsystems with alternative implementations leads to a dramatic increase in interface complexity. We will continue studying the `SearchBox` component from the previous chapter. Allow us to remind the reader of the factors that complicate the design of APIs for visual components:
  * Coupling heterogeneous functionality (such as business logic, appearance styling, and behavior) into a single entity
  * Introducing shared resources, i.e. an object state that could be simultaneously modified by different actors, including the end user
  * The emergence of ambivalent hierarchies in the inheritance of entity properties and options.

Let's make the task more specific. Imagine that we need to develop a `SearchBox` that allows for the following modifications:
  1. Replacing the textual paragraphs representing an offer with a map with markers that could be highlighted:

      [![APP](/img/mockups/05.png "Search results on a map")]()

      * This illustrates the problem of replacing a subcomponent (the offer list) while preserving the behavior and design of other parts of the system as well as the complexity of implementing shared states.

  2. Combining short and full descriptions of an offer in a single UI (a list item could be expanded, and the order can be created in-place):

      [![APP](/img/mockups/06.png "A list of offers with short descriptions")]()

      [![APP](/img/mockups/07.png "A list of offers with some of them expanded")]()

      * This illustrates the problem of fully removing a subcomponent and transferring its business logic to other parts of the system.

  3. Manipulating the data presented to the user and the available actions for an offer through adding new buttons, such as “Previous offer,” “Next offer,” and “Make a call.”

      [![APP](/img/mockups/08.png "An offer panel with additional icons and buttons")]()
  
      In this scenario, we're evaluating different chains of propagating data and options down to the offer panel and building dynamic UIs on top of it:

      * Some data fields (such as the logo and phone number) are properties of a real object received in the search API response.

      * Some data fields make sense only in the context of this specific UI and reflect its design principles (for instance, the “Previous” and “Next” buttons).

      * Some data fields (such as the icons of the “Not now” and “Make a call” buttons) are bound to the button type (i.e., the business logic it provides).

The obvious approach to tackling these scenarios appears to be creating two additional subcomponents responsible for presenting a list of offers and the details of the specific offer. Let's name them `OfferList` and `OfferPanel` respectively.

[![PLOT](/img/mockups/09.png "The subcomponents of a `SearchBox`")]()

If we had no customization requirements, the pseudo-code implementing interactions between all three components would look rather trivial:

```typescript
class SearchBox implements ISearchBox {
  // The responsibility of `SearchBox` is:
  // 1. Creating a container for rendering
  // an offer list, preparing option values
  // and creating the `OfferList` instance
  constructor(container, options) {
    …
    this.offerList = new OfferList(
      this,
      offerListContainer,
      offerListOptions
    );
  }
  // 2. Triggering an offer search when 
  // a user presses the corresponding button
  // and providing an analogous programmable
  // interface for developers
  onSearchButtonClick() {
    this.search(this.searchInput.value);
  }
  search(query) {
    …
  }
  // 3. Notifying about new search results
  // being received from the server
  onSearchResultsReceived(searchResults) {
    …
    this.offerList.setOfferList(searchResults)
  }
  // 4. Creating orders (and manipulating 
  // subcomponents if needed)
  createOrder(offer) {
    this.offerList.destroy();
    ourCoffeeSdk.createOrder(offer);
    …
  }
  // 5. Self-destructing if requested
  destroy() {
    this.offerList.destroy();
    …
  }
}
```

```typescript
class OfferList implements IOfferList {
  // The responsibility of `OfferList` is:
  // 1. Creating a container for rendering
  // an offer panel, preparing option values
  // and creating the `OfferPanel` instance
  constructor(searchBox, container, options) {
    …
    this.offerPanel = new OfferPanel(
      searchBox,
      offerPanelContainer,
      offerPanelOptions
    );
    …
  }
  // 2. Providing a method to change the list
  // of offers to be presented
  setOfferList(offerList) { … }
  // 3. When an offer is selected, opening
  // an offer panel to present it
  onOfferClick(offer) {
    this.offerPanel.show(offer)
  }
  // 4. Self-destructing if requested
  destroy() {
    this.offerPanel.destroy();
    …
  }
}
```

```typescript
class OfferPanel implements IOfferPanel {
  constructor(
    searchBox, container, options
  ) { … }
  // The responsibility of `OfferPanel` is:
  // 1. Presenting an offer
  show(offer) { 
    this.offer = offer;
    …
  }
  // 2. Creating an order when the user
  // presses the “Place an order” button
  onCreateOrderButtonClick() {
    this.searchBox.createOrder(this.offer);
  }
  // 3. Closing itself when the user
  // presses the “Not now” button
  onCancelButtonClick() {
    // …
  }
  // 4. Self-destructing if requested
  destroy() { … }
}
```

The `ISearchBox` / `IOfferPanel` / `IOfferView` interfaces are concise as well (constructors and destructors omitted):

```typescript
interface ISearchBox {
  search(query);
  createOrder(offer);
}
interface IOfferList {
  setOfferList(offerList);
}
interface IOfferPanel {
  show(offer);
}
```

If we aren't making an SDK and have not had the task of making these components customizable, the approach would be perfectly viable. However, let's discuss how we would solve the three sample tasks described above.

  1. Displaying an offer list on the map: at first glance, we can develop an alternative component for displaying offers that implements the `IOfferList` interface (let's call it `OfferMap`) and reuses the standard offer panel. However, we have a problem: `OfferList` only sends commands to `OfferPanel` while `OfferMap` also needs to receive feedback — an event of panel closure to deselect a marker. The API of our components does not encompass this functionality, and implementing it is not that simple:

      ```typescript
      class CustomOfferPanel extends OfferPanel {
        constructor(
          searchBox, offerMap, container, options
        ) {
          this.offerMap = offerMap;
          super(searchBox, container, options);
        }
        onCancelButtonClick() {
          /* <em> */offerMap.resetCurrentOffer();/* </em> */
          super.onCancelButtonClick();
        }
      }
      class OfferMap implements IOfferList {
        constructor(searchBox, container, options) {
          …
          this.offerPanel = new CustomOfferPanel(
            this,
            searchBox,
            offerPanelContainer,
            offerPanelOptions
          )
        }
        resetCurrentOffer() { … }
        …
      }
      ```

      We have to create a `CustomOfferPanel` class, and this implementation, unlike its parent class, now only works with `OfferMap`, not with any `IOfferList`-compatible component.
  
  2. The case of making full offer details and action controls in place in the offer list is pretty obvious: we can achieve this only by writing a new `IOfferList`-compatible component from scratch because whatever overrides we apply to the standard `OfferList`, it will continue creating an `OfferPanel` and open it upon offer selection.

  3. To implement new buttons, we can only propose to developers to create a custom offer list component (to provide methods for selecting previous and next offers) and a custom offer panel that will call these methods. If we find a simple solution for customizing, let's say, the “Place an order” button text, this solution needs to be supported in the `OfferList` code:

      ```typescript
      let searchBox = new SearchBox(…, {
        /* <em> */offerPanelCreateOrderButtonText:
          'Drink overpriced coffee!'/* </em> */
      });

      class OfferList {
        constructor(…, options) {
          …
          // It is `OfferList`'s responsibility
          // to isolate the injection point and
          // to propagate the overridden value
          // to the `OfferPanel` instance
          this.offerPanel = new OfferPanel(…, {
            /* <em> */createOrderButtonText: options
              .offerPanelCreateOrderButtonText/* </em> */
            …
          })
        }
      }
      ```

The solutions we discuss are also poorly extendable. For example, in \#1, if we decide to make the offer list react to the closing of an offer panel as a part of the standard interface for developers to use, we will need to add a new method to the `IOfferList` interface and make it optional to maintain backward compatibility:

```typescript
interface IOfferList {
  …
  onOfferPanelClose?();
}
```

In the `OfferPanel` code, the support of this new method will look like:

```typescript
if (Type(this.offerList.onOfferPanelClose)
  == 'function') {
    this.offerList.onOfferPanelClose();
  }
```

Certainly, this will not make our code any cleaner. Additionally, `OfferList` and `OfferPanel` will become even more tightly coupled.

As we discussed in the “[Weak Coupling](#back-compat-weak-coupling)” chapter, to solve such problems we need to reduce the strong coupling of the components in favor of weak coupling, for example, by generating events instead of calling methods directly. An `IOfferPanel` could have emitted a `'close'` event, so that an `OfferList` could have listened to it:

```typescript
class OfferList {
  setup() {
    …
    /* <em> */this.offerPanel.events.on(/* </em> */
      /* <em> */'close'/* </em> */,
      function () {
        this.resetCurrentOffer();
      }
    )
  }
  …
}
```

This code looks more sensible but doesn't eliminate the mutual dependencies of the components: an `OfferList` still cannot be used without an `OfferPanel` as required in Case \#2.

Let us note that all the code samples above are a full chaos of abstraction levels: an `OfferList` instantiates an `OfferPanel` and manages it directly, and an `OfferPanel` has to jump over levels to create an order. We can try to unlink them if we route all calls through the `SearchBox` itself, for example, like this:

```typescript
class SearchBox() {
  constructor() {
    this.offerList = new OfferList(…);
    this.offerPanel = new OfferPanel(…);
    this.offerList.events.on(
      'offerSelect', function (offer) {
        this.offerPanel.show(offer);
      }
    );
    this.offerPanel.events.on(
      'close', function () {
        this.offerList
          .resetSelectedOffer();
      }
    );
  }
}
```

Now `OfferList` and `OfferPanel` are independent, but we have another issue: to replace them with alternative implementations we have to change the `SearchBox` itself. We can go even further and make it like this:

```typescript
class SearchBox {
  constructor() {
    …
    this.offerList.events.on(
      'offerSelect', function (event) {
        this.events.emit('offerSelect', {
          offer: event.selectedOffer
        });
      }
    );
  }
  …
}
```

So a `SearchBox` just translates events, maybe with some data alterations. We can even force the `SearchBox` to transmit *any* events of child components, which will allow us to extend the functionality by adding new events. However, this is definitely not the responsibility of a high-level component, being mostly a proxy for translating events. Also, using these event chains is error prone. For example, how should the functionality of selecting a next offer in the offer panel (Case \#3) be implemented? We need an `OfferList` to both generate an `'offerSelect'` event *and* react when the parent context emits it. One can easily create an infinite loop of it:

```typescript
class OfferList {
  constructor(searchBox, …) {
    …
    searchBox.events.on(
      'offerSelect',
      this.selectOffer
    );
  }

  selectOffer(offer) {
    …
    this.events.emit(
      'offerSelect', offer
    );
  }
}
```

```typescript
class SearchBox {
  constructor() {
    …
    this.offerList.events.on(
      'offerSelect', function (offer) {
        …
        this.events.emit(
          'offerSelect', offer
        );
      }
    );
  }
}
```

To avoid infinite loops, we could split the events:

```typescript
class SearchBox {
  constructor() {
    …
    // An `OfferList` notifies about 
    // low-level events, while a `SearchBox`,
    // about high-level ones
    this.offerList.events.on(
      /* <em> */'click'/* </em> */, function (target) {
        …
        this.events.emit(
          /* <em> */'offerSelect'/* </em> */,
          target.dataset.offer
        );
      }
    );
  }
}
```

Then the code will become ultimately unmaintainable: to open an `OfferPanel`, developers will need to generate a `'click'` event on an `OfferList` instance.

In the end, we have already examined five different options for decomposing a UI component employing very different approaches, but found no acceptable solution. Obviously, we can conclude that the problem is not about specific interfaces. What is it about, then?

Let us formulate what the responsibility of each of the components is:

  1. `SearchBox` presents the general interface. It is an entry point both for users and developers. If we ask ourselves what a maximum abstract component still constitutes a `SearchBox`, the response will obviously be “the one that allows for entering a search phrase and presenting the results in the UI with the ability to place an order.”

  2. `OfferList` serves the purpose of showing offers to users. The user can interact with a list — iterate over offers and “activate” them (i.e., perform some actions on a list item).

  3. `OfferPanel` displays a specific offer and renders *all* the information that is meaningful for the user. There is always exactly one `OfferPanel`. The user can work with the panel, performing actions related to this specific offer (including placing an order).

Does the `SearchBox` description entail the necessity of `OfferList`'s existence? Obviously, not: we can imagine quite different variants of UI for presenting offers to the users. An `OfferList` is a *specific case* of organizing the `SearchBox`'s functionality for presenting search results. Conversely, the idea of “selecting an offer” and the concepts of `OfferList` and `OfferPanel` performing *different* actions and having *different* options are equally inconsequential to the `SearchBox` definition. At the `SearchBox` level, it doesn't matter *how* the search results are presented and *what states* the corresponding UI could have.

This leads to a simple conclusion: we cannot decompose `SearchBox` just because we lack a sufficient number of abstraction levels and try to jump over them. We need a “bridge” between an abstract `SearchBox` that does not depend on specific UI and the `OfferList` / `OfferPanel` components that present a specific case of such a UI. Let us artificially introduce an additional abstraction level (let us call it a “Composer”) to control the data flow:

```typescript
class SearchBoxComposer 
  implements ISearchBoxComposer {
  // The responsibility of a “Composer” comprises:
  // 1. Creating a context for nested subcomponents
  constructor(searchBox, container, options) {
    …
    // The context consists of the list of offers 
    // and the current selected offer
    // (both could be empty)
    this.offerList = null;
    this.currentOffer = null;
    // 2. Creating subcomponents and translating
    // their options
    this.offerList = this.buildOfferList();
    this.offerPanel = this.buildOfferPanel();
    // 3. Managing own state and notifying
    // about state changes
    this.searchBox.events.on(
      'offerListChange', this.onOfferListChange
    );
    // 4. Listening
    this.offerListComponent.events.on(
      'offerSelect', this.selectOffer
    );
    this.offerPanelComponent.events.on(
        'action', this.performAction
    );
  }
}
```

The builder methods to create subcomponents, manage their options and potentially their position on the screen would look like this:

```typescript
class SearchBoxComposer {
  …

  buildOfferList() {
    return new OfferList(
      this,
      this.offerListContainer,
      this.generateOfferListOptions()
    );
  }

  buildOfferPanel() {
    return new OfferPanel(
      this,
      this.offerPanelContainer,
      this.generateOfferPanelOptions()
    );
  }
}
```

We can put the burden of translating contexts on `SearchBoxComposer`. In particular, the following tasks could be handled by the composer:

  1. Preparing and translating the data. At this level we can stipulate that an `OfferList` shows short information (a “preview”) about the offer, while an `OfferPanel` presents full information, and provide potentially overridable methods of generating the required data facets:

      ```typescript
      class SearchBoxComposer {
        …
        onContextOfferListChange(offerList) {
          …
          // A `SearchBoxComposer` translates
          // an `offerListChange` event as 
          // an `offerPreviewListChange` for the
          // `OfferList` subcomponent, thus preventing
          // an infinite loop in the code, and prepares
          // the data
          this.events.emit('offerPreviewListChange', {
            offerList: this.generateOfferPreviews(
              this.offerList,
              this.contextOptions
            )
          });
        }
      }
      ```
  
  2. Managing the composer's own state (the `currentOffer` field in our case):

      ```typescript
      class SearchBoxComposer {
        …
        onContextOfferListChange(offerList) {
          // If an offer is shown when the user
          // enters a new search phrase, 
          // it should be hidden
          if (this.currentOffer !== null) {
            this.currentOffer = null;
            // This is an event specifically
            // for the `OfferPanel` to listen to
            this.events.emit(
              'offerFullViewToggle', 
              { offer: null }
            );
          }
          …
        }
      }
      ```

  3. Transforming user's actions on a subcomponent into events or actions on the other components or the parent context:

      ```typescript
      class SearchBoxComposer {
        …
        public performAction({
          action, offerId
        }) {
          switch (action) {
            case 'createOrder':
              // The “place an order” action is
              // to be handled by the `SearchBox`
              this.createOrder(offerId);
              break;
            case 'close':
              // The closing of the offer panel 
              // event is to be exposed publicly
              if (this.currentOffer != null) {
                this.currentOffer = null;
                this.events.emit(
                  'offerFullViewToggle', 
                  { offer: null }
                );
              }
              break;
            …
          }
        }
      }
      ```

If we revisit the cases we began this chapter with, we can now outline solutions for each of them:

  1. Presenting search results on a map doesn't change the concept of the list-and-panel UI. We need to implement a custom `IOfferList` and override the `buildOfferList` method in the composer.

  2. Combining the list and the panel functionality contradicts the UI concept, so we will need to create a custom `ISearchBoxComposer`. However, we can reuse the standard `OfferList` as the composer manages both the data for it and the reactions to the user's actions.

  3. Enriching the data is compatible with the UI concept, so we continue using standard components. What we need is overriding the functionality of preparing `OfferPanel`'s data and options, and implementing additional events and actions for the composer to translate.

The price of this flexibility is the overwhelming complexity of component communications. Each event and data field must be propagated through the chains of such “composers” that elongate the abstraction hierarchy. Every transformation in this chain (for example, generating options for subcomponents or reacting to context events) is to be implemented in an extendable and parametrizable way. We can only offer reasonable helpers to ease using such customization. However, in the SDK code, the complexity will always be present. This is the way.

The reference implementation of all the components with the interfaces we discussed and all three customization cases can be found in this book's repository:
