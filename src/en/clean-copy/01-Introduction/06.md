### [On Backward Compatibility][intro-back-compat]

Backward compatibility is a *temporal* characteristic of an API. The obligation to maintain backward compatibility is the crucial point where API development differs from software development in general.

Of course, backward compatibility isn't absolute. In some subject areas shipping new backward-incompatible API versions is routine. Nevertheless, every time a new backward-incompatible API version is deployed, developers need to make some non-zero effort to adapt their code to the new version. In this sense, releasing new API versions puts a sort of “tax” on customers who must spend quite real money just to ensure their product continues working.

Large companies that occupy solid market positions could afford to charge such a tax. Furthermore, they may introduce penalties for those who refuse to adapt their code to new API versions, up to disabling their applications.

From our point of view, such a practice cannot be justified. Don't impose hidden levies on your customers. **If you can avoid breaking backward compatibility, never break it**.

Of course, maintaining old API versions is a sort of tax as well. Technology changes, and you cannot foresee everything, regardless of how nicely your API is initially designed. At some point keeping old API versions results in an inability to provide new functionality and support new platforms, and you will be forced to release a new version. But at least you will be able to explain to your customers why they need to make an effort.

We will discuss API lifecycle and version policies in Section II.
