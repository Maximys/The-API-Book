### Backwards Compatibility

Backwards compatibility is a *temporal* characteristic of your API. An obligation to maintain backwards compatibility is the crucial point where API development differs from software development in general.

Of course, backwards compatibility isn't an absolute. In some subject areas shipping new backwards-incompatible API versions is a routine. Nevertheless, every time you deploy a new backwards-incompatible API version, the developers need to make some non-zero effort to adapt their code to the new API version. In this sense, releasing new API versions puts a sort of a “tax” on customers. They must spend quite real money just to make sure their product continues working.

Large companies, which occupy firm market positions, could afford to imply such taxation. Furthermore, they may introduce penalties for those who refuse to adapt their code to new API versions, up to disabling their applications.

From our point of view, such a practice cannot be justified. Don't imply hidden taxes on your customers. If you're able to avoid breaking backwards compatibility — never break it.

Of course, maintaining old API versions is a sort of a tax either. Technology changes, and you cannot foresee everything, regardless of how nice your API is initially designed. At some point keeping old API versions results in an inability to provide new functionality and support new platforms, and you will be forced to release a new version. But at least you will be able to explain to your customers why they need to make an effort.

We will discuss API lifecycle and version policies in Section II.
