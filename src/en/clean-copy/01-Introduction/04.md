### [Choosing Solutions for API Development][intro-api-choosing-solutions]

Let's return to the metaphor of an API as an aqueduct connecting two contexts. While striving to make the use of our construct convenient for customers, we encounter another side of the problem: how would our customers prefer our API to be designed? Are there any widely adopted techniques for connecting water pipes in our subject area?

In most cases, such standards exist; someone has already designed similar APIs before. The farther apart two contexts are, the more abstractions are invented to connect them, and the more frameworks are developed to work with these abstractions.

Utilizing conventional techniques is an essential component of API quality. In areas where an established communication standard exists (such as, for example, the TCP/IP protocol in computer networks), inventing a new one is only viable if you are one hundred percent certain that its advantages will be so obvious that developers will forgive the necessity of learning a new technology to work with the API.

However, in many subject areas, such certainty does not exist. On the contrary, various paradigms of API design compete against each other, and you will have to make a choice in favor of one of them (or develop a custom solution). We will discuss two such areas in sections IV and V of this book:
  * Selecting a paradigm for organizing client-server communication (such as REST API, RPC, GraphQL, etc.) — in the “[Advantages and Disadvantages of HTTP APIs Compared to Alternative Technologies](#http-api-pros-and-cons)” chapter
  * Selecting an approach to developing UI components — in the “[On Terminology. An Overview of Technologies for UI Development](#sdk-toc-technology-overview)” chapter.
