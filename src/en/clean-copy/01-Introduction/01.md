### On the Structure of This Book

The book you're holding in your hands comprises this Introduction and two sections: ‘The API Design’ and ‘The Backwards Compatibility’.

In Section I, we will discuss designing APIs as a concept: how to build the architecture properly, from high-level planning down to final interfaces.

Section II is dedicated to an API lifecycle: how interfaces evolve over time, and how to elaborate the product to match users' needs.

One more section is planned for the future: the ‘API as a Product’ section will be more about the un-engineering sides of the API, like API marketing, organizing customer support, and working with a community.

First, two sections are interesting to engineers mostly, while the third section is more relevant to both engineers and product managers. However, we insist that the third section is the most important for the API software developer. Since an API is a product for engineers, you cannot simply pronounce a non-engineering team responsible for product planning and support. Nobody but you understands more about your API's product features.

Let's start.
