### On Versioning

Here and throughout we firmly stick to [semver](https://semver.org/) principles of versioning:
  1. API versions are denoted with three numbers, i.e. `1.2.3`.
  1. First number (major version) increases when backwards-incompatible changes in the API are shipped.
  2. Second number (minor version) increases when new functionality is added to the API, keeping backwards compatibility intact.
  3. Third number (patch) increases when a new API version contains bug fixes only.

Sentences ‘major API version’ and ‘new API version, containing backwards-incompatible changes’ are therefore to be considered equivalent ones.

In Section II we will discuss versioning policies in more detail. In Section I, we will just use semver versions designation, specifically `v1`, `v2`, etc.
