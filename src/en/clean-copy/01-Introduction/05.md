### [The API-first approach][intro-api-first-approach]

Today, more and more IT companies accept the importance of the “API-first” approach, e.g. the paradigm of developing software with a heavy focus on developing APIs.

However, we must differentiate the product concept of the API-first approach from a technical one. 

The former means that the first (and sometimes the only) step in developing a service is creating an API for it, and we will discuss it in “The API Product” section of this book.

If we, however, talk about the API-first approach in a technical sense, we mean the following: **the contract, e.g. the obligation to connect two programmable contexts, precedes the implementation and defines it**. More specifically, two rules are to be respected:
  * the contract is developed and committed in a form of a specification before the functionality is implemented;
  * if it turns out that the implementation and the contract differ, it is the implementation to be fixed, not the contract.

The “specification” in this context is a formal machine-readable description of the contract in one of the interface definition languages (IDL) — for example, in a form of a Swagger/OpenAPI document or a `.proto` file.

Both rules assert that partner developers' interests are given the highest priority:
  * rule \#1 allows partners for writing code based on the specification without coordinating the process with the API provider;
    * the possibility of auto-generating code based on the specification emerges, and that might make development significantly less complex or even automate it;
    * the code might be developed without having an access to the API;
  * rule \#2 means partners won't need to change their implementations should some inconsistencies between the specification and the API functionality pop up.

Therefore, for your API consumers, the API-first approach is a guarantee of a kind. However, it only works if the API was initially well-designed: if some irreparable flaws in the specification surfaced out, we would have no other option but break rule \#2.
