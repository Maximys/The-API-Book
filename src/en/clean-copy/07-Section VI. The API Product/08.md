### [Identifying Users and Preventing Fraud][api-product-antifraud]

In the context of working with an API, we talk about two kinds of users of the system:
  * Users-developers, i.e., your partners writing code atop of the API
  * End users interacting with applications implemented by the users-developers.

In most cases, you need to have both of them identified (in a technical sense: discern one unique customer from another) to have answers to the following questions:
  * How many users are interacting with the system (simultaneously, daily, monthly, and yearly)?
  * How many actions does each user make?

**NB**. Sometimes, when an API is very large and/or abstract, the chain linking the API vendor to end users might comprise more than one developer as large partners provide services implemented atop of the API to the smaller ones. You need to count both direct and “derivative” partners.

Gathering this data is crucial because of two reasons:
  * To understand the system's limits and to be capable of planning its growth
  * To understand the number of resources (ultimately, money) that are spent (and gained) on each user.

In the case of commercial APIs, the quality and timeliness of gathering this data are twice that important, as the tariff plans (and therefore the entire business model) depend on it. Therefore, the question of *how exactly* we're identifying users is crucial.

#### Identifying Applications and Their Owners

Let's start with the first user category, i.e., API business partners-developers. The important remark: there are two different entities we must learn to identify, namely applications and their owners.

An application is roughly speaking a logically separate case of API usage, usually — literally an application (mobile or desktop one) or a website, i.e., some technical entity. Meanwhile, an owner is a legal body that you have the API usage agreement signed. If API Terms of Service (ToS) imply different limits and/or tariffs depending on the type of the service or the way it uses the API, this automatically means the necessity to track one owner's applications separately.

In the modern world, the factual standard for identifying both entities is using API keys: a developer who wants to start using an API must obtain an API key bound to their contact info. Thus the key identifies the application while the contact data identifies the owner.

Though this practice is universally widespread we can't but notice that in most cases it's useless, and sometimes just destructive.

Its general advantage is the necessity to supply actual contact info to get a key, which theoretically allows for contacting the application owner if needed. (In the real world, it doesn't work: key owners often don't read mailboxes they provided upon registration; and if the owner is a company, it easily might be a no-one's mailbox or a personal email of some employee that left the company a couple of years ago.)

The main disadvantage of using API keys is that they *don't* allow for reliably identifying both applications and their owners.

If there are free limits to API usage, there is a temptation to obtain many API keys bound to different owners to fit those free limits. You may raise the bar of having such multi-accounts by requiring, let's say, providing a phone number or bank card data, but there are popular services for automatically issuing both.  Paying for a virtual SIM or credit card (to say nothing about buying the stolen ones) will always be cheaper than paying the proper API tariff — unless it's the API for creating those cards. Therefore, API key-based user identification (if you're not requiring the physical contract to be signed) does not mean you don't need to double-check whether users comply with the terms of service and do not issue several keys for one app.

Another problem is that an API key might be simply stolen from a lawful partner; in the case of mobile or web applications, that's quite trivial.

It might look like the problem is not that important in the case of server-to-server integrations, but it actually is. Imagine that a partner provides a public service of their own that uses your API under the hood. That usually means there is an endpoint in the partner's backend that performs a request to the API and returns the result, and this endpoint perfectly suits as a free replacement of direct access to the API for a cybercriminal. Of course, you might say this fraud is a problem of partners', but, first, it would be naïve to expect each partner develops their own anti-fraud system, and, second, it's just sub-optimal: obviously, a centralized anti-fraud system would be way more effective than a bunch of amateur implementations. Also, server keys might also be stolen: it's much harder than stealing client keys but doable. With any popular API, sooner or later you will face the situation of stolen keys made available to the public (or a key owner just shared it with acquaintances out of the kindness of their heart).

One way or another, a problem of independent validation arises: how can we control whether the API endpoint is requested by a user in compliance with the terms of service?

Mobile applications might be conveniently tracked through their identifiers in the corresponding store (Google Play, App Store, etc.), so it makes sense to require this identifier to be passed by partners as an API initialization parameter. Websites with some degree of confidence might be identified by the `Referer` and `Origin` HTTP headers.

This data is not itself reliable, but it allows for making cross-checks:
  * If a key was issued for one specific domain but requests are coming with a different `Referer`, it makes sense to investigate the situation and maybe ban the possibility to access the API with this `Referer` or this key.
  * If an application initializes API by providing a key registered to another application, it makes sense to contact the store administration and ask for removing one of the apps.

**NB**: don't forget to set infinite limits for using the API with the `localhost`, `127.0.0.1` / `[::1]` `Referer`s, and also for your own sandbox if it exists. Yes, abusers will sooner or later learn this fact and will start exploiting it, but otherwise, you will ban local development and your own website much sooner than that.

The general conclusion is:
  * It is highly desirable to have partners formally identified (either through obtaining API keys or by providing contact data such as website domain or application identifier in a store while initializing the API).
  * This information shall not be trusted unconditionally; there must be double-checking mechanisms that identify suspicious requests.

#### Identifying End Users

Usually, you can put forward some requirements for self-identifying of partners, but asking end users to reveal contact information is impossible in most cases. All the methods of measuring the audience described below are imprecise and often heuristic. (Even if partner application functionality is only available after registration and you do have access to that profile data, it's still a game of assumptions, as an individual account is not the same as an individual user: several different persons might use a single account, or, vice versa, one person might register many accounts.) Also, note that gathering this sort of data might be legally regulated (though we will be mostly speaking about anonymized data, there might still be some applicable law).

  1. The most simple and obvious indicator is an IP address. It's very hard to counterfeit them (i.e., the API server always knows the remote address), and the IP address statistics are reasonably demonstrative.

      If the API is provided as a server-to-server one, there will be no access to the end user's IP address. However, it makes sense to require partners to propagate the IP address (for example, in a form of the `X-Forwarded-For` header) — among other things, to help partners fight fraud and unintended usage of the API.

      Until recently, IP addresses were also a convenient statistics indicator because it was quite expensive to get a large pool of unique addresses. However, with ipv6 advancement this restriction is no longer actual; ipv6 rather put the light on the fact that you can't just count unique addresses — the aggregates are to be tracked:

        * The cumulative number of requests by networks, i.e., the hierarchical calculations (the number of /8, /16, /24, etc. networks)
        * The cumulative statistics by autonomous networks (AS)
        * The API requests through known public proxies and TOR network.
      
      An abnormal number of requests in one network might be evidence of the API being actively used inside some corporative environment (or NATs being widespread in the region).

  2. Additional means of tracking are users' unique identifiers, most notably cookies. However, most recently this method of gathering data got attacked from several directions: browser makers restrict third-party cookies, users are employing anti-tracker software, and lawmakers started to roll out legal requirements against data collection. In the current situation, it's much easier to drop cookie usage than to be compliant with all the regulations.

      All this leads to a situation when public APIs (especially those installed on free-to-use sites and applications) are very limited in the means of collecting statistics and analyzing user behavior. And that impacts not only fighting all kinds of fraud but analyzing use cases as well. This is the way.

**NB**. In some jurisdictions, IP addresses are considered personal data, and collecting them is prohibited as well. We don't dare to advise on how an API vendor might at the same time be able to fight prohibited content on the platform and don't have access to users' IP addresses. We presume that complying with such legislation implies storing statistics by IP address hashes. (And just in case we won't mention that building a rainbow table for SHA-256 hashes covering the entire 4-billion range of IPv4 addresses would take several hours on a regular office-grade computer.)
