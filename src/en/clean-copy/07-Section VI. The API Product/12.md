### [Testing Environments][api-product-testing]

If the operations executed via the API imply consequences for end users or partners (cost money, in particular) you must provide a test version of the API. In this testing API, real-world actions either don't happen at all (for instance, orders are created but nobody serves them) or are simulated by cheaper means (let's say, instead of sending an SMS to a user, an email is sent to the developer's mailbox).

However, in many cases having a test version is not enough — like in our coffee-machine API example. If an order is created but not served, partners are not able to test the functionality of delivering the order or requesting a refund. To run the full cycle of testing, developers need the capability of pushing the order through stages, as this would happen in reality.

A direct solution to this problem is providing test versions for a full set of APIs and administrative interfaces. It means that developers will be able to run a second application in parallel — the one you're giving to coffee shops so they might get and serve orders (and if there is a delivery functionality, the third app as well: the courier's one) — and make all these actions that coffee shop staff normally does. Obviously, that's not an ideal solution, because of several reasons:
  * Developers of end user applications will need to additionally learn how coffee shop and courier apps work, which has nothing to do with the task they're solving.
  * You will need to invent and implement some matching algorithm: an order made through a test application must be assigned to a specific virtual courier; this actually means creating an isolated virtual “sandbox” (meaning — a full set of services) for each specific partner.
  * Executing a full “happy path” of an order will take minutes, maybe tens of minutes, and will require making a multitude of actions in several different interfaces.

There are two main approaches to tackling these problems.

##### The Testing Environment API

The first option is providing a meta-API to the testing environment itself. Instead of running the coffee-shop app in a separate simulator, developers are provided with helper methods (like `simulateOrderPreparation`) or some visual interface that allows controlling the order execution pipeline with minimum effort.

Ideally, you should provide helper methods for any actions that are conducted by people in the production environment. It makes sense to ship this meta-API complete with ready-to-use scripts or request collections that show the correct API call orders for standard scenarios. 

The disadvantage of this approach is that client developers still need to know how the “flip side” of the system works, though in simplified terms.

##### The Simulator of Pre-Defined Scenarios

The alternative to providing the testing environment API is simulating the working scenarios. In this case, the testing environment takes control over “underwater” parts of the system and “plays out” all external agents' actions. In our coffee example, that means that, after the order is submitted, the system will simulate all the preparation steps and then the delivery of the beverage to the customer.

The advantage of this approach is that it demonstrates vividly how the system works according to the API vendor design plans, e.g., in which sequence the events are generated, and which stages the order passes through. It also reduces the chance of making mistakes in testing scripts, as the API vendor guarantees the actions will be executed in the correct order with the right parameters.

The main disadvantage is the necessity to create a separate scenario for each unhappy path (effectively, for every possible error), and give developers the capability of denoting which scenario they want to run. (For example, like that: if there is a pre-agreed comment to the order, the system will simulate a specific error, and developers will be able to write and debug the code that deals with the error.)

#### The Automation of Testing

Your final goal in implementing testing APIs, regardless of which option you choose, is allowing partners to automate the QA process for their products. The testing environment should be developed with this purpose in mind; for example, if an end user might be brought to a 3-D Secure page to pay for the order, the testing environment API must provide some way of simulating the successful (or not) passing of this step. Also, in both variants, it's possible (and desirable) to allow running the scenarios in a fast-forward manner that will allow making auto-testing much faster than manual testing.

Of course, not every partner will be able to employ this possibility (which also means that a “manual” way of testing usage scenarios must always be supported alongside the programmatical one) simply because not every business might afford to hire a QA automation engineer. Nevertheless, the ability to write such auto-tests is your API's huge competitive advantage from a technically advanced partner's point of view.
