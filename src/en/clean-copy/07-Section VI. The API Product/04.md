### [Communicating with Developers][api-product-devrel]

As we have described in the previous chapters, managing an API product requires building relationships with both business partners and developers. (Ideally, with end users as well, although this option is seldom available to API providers.)

Let's start with developers. The specifics of software engineers as an audience are as follows:
  * Developers are highly educated individuals with practical thinking. As a rule, they choose technical products with extreme rationality (unless you're giving them cool backpacks with fancy prints for free).
      * This doesn't prevent them from having a certain aptitude towards, let's say, specific programming languages or frameworks; however, *influencing* those aptitudes is extremely hard and is normally not within the API vendor's power.
  * Developers are quite skeptical towards promotional materials and overstatements. They are ready to actually check whether your claims are true.
  * It is very hard to communicate with developers via regular marketing channels. They get information from highly specialized communities and they stick to opinions proved by concrete numbers and examples (ideally, code samples).
      * The words of “influencers” are not very valuable to them, as no opinions are trusted if unsubstantiated.
  * The ideas of open source and free software are widespread among developers If you try to make money out of things that they believe should be free and/or open (for example, by proclaiming interfaces as intellectual property), you will face resistance (and views on these “shoulds” differ).

Because of the aforementioned specifics (especially the relative insignificance of influencers and the critical attitude towards promotions), you will have to communicate to developers via very specific media:
  * Collective blogs (like the “r/programming” subreddit or dev.to)
  * Q&A sites (Stack Overflow, Experts Exchange)
  * Educational services (Codecademy, Udemy)
  * Technical conferences and webinars.

In all these channels, direct advertising of your API is either problematic or impossible. (Well, strictly speaking, you may buy a banner on one of the sites advertising the advantages of your API, but we highly doubt it will improve your relations with developers.) You need to generate valuable and/or interesting content for them, which will improve their knowledge of your API. And this is the job for your developers: writing articles, answering questions, recording webinars, and giving pitches.

Developers enjoy sharing their experiences and will probably be eager to do so — during their work hours. A proper conference talk, let alone an educational course, requires a lot of preparation time. From this book's author's experience, two things are crucial for tech PR:
  * Incentives, even nominal ones — the job of promoting a product should be rewarded
  * Methodicalness and quality standards — you might actually do content review just like you do code review.

Nothing could be worse counter-advertising for your product than a poorly prepared pitch (as we said, mistakes will inevitably be found and pointed out) or a badly camouflaged commercial in the form of a pitch (the reason is actually the same). Texts need to be worked upon: pay attention to the structure, logic, and tempo of the narration. Even a technical story must be finely constructed; after it's ended, the listeners must have a clear understanding of the idea you wanted to communicate (and it should rather be linked with your API's fitness for their needs).

A word on “evangelists” (those are people who have credibility in the IT community and work on promoting a technology or a tech company, either as a company's contractor or even a staff member, effectively carrying out all those aforementioned activities, such as blog posting, course preparing, conference speaking, etc.) Having an evangelist makes the API development team exempt from the necessity of performing tech PR. However, we would rather advise having this expertise inside the team, as direct interaction with developers helps in forming the product vision. (That doesn't mean evangelists are not needed at all - you might well combine these two strategies.)

#### Open Source

The important question that will sooner or later arise for any API vendor is whether to make the source code open. This decision has both advantages and disadvantages:
  * You will improve the knowledge of the brand, and some respect will be paid to you by the IT community.
      * Given that your code is finely written and commented.
  * You will receive some additional feedback, ideally in the form of pull requests from third-party developers.
      * You will also receive a number of inquiries and comments ranging from useless to obviously provocative ones, to which you will have to respond politely.
  * Donating code to open source makes developers trust the company more, and affects their readiness to rely on the platform.
      * However, it also increases risks, both from an information security point of view and in terms of the product, as a dissatisfied community might fork your repository and create a competing product.

Finally, just the preparations to make the code open might be very expensive. You need to clean the code, switch to open building and testing tools, and remove all references to proprietary resources. This decision is to be made very cautiously after considering all pros and cons. We might add that many companies try to reduce the risks by splitting the API code into two parts: the open one and the proprietary one. Additionally, the risks could be mitigated by selecting a license that disallows harming the company's interests by using the open-sourced code (for example, by prohibiting selling hosted solutions or by requiring the derivative works to be open-sourced as well).

#### The Audience Fragmentation

There is one very important addition to the discourse: as information technologies are universally in great demand, a significant percentage of your customers will not be professional software engineers. A huge number of people are somewhere on the path to mastering the occupation. Some are trying to write code in addition to the basic duties, others are undergoing retraining, and some are studying the basics of computer science on their own. Many of these non-professional developers have a direct impact on the process of selecting an API vendor, such as small business owners who seek to automate routine tasks programmatically.

It would be more accurate to say that API providers are actually working for two main types of audiences:
  * Beginners and amateurs, for whom each integration task would be completely new and unexplored territory
  * Professional developers who possess vast experience in integrating different third-party systems.

This fact greatly affects everything we discussed previously (except for, perhaps, open-sourcing, as amateur developers pay little attention to it):
  * Your pitches, webinars, lectures, etc., must somehow cater to both professional and semi-professional audiences. 
  * A significant share of inquiries to your customer support service will be generated by the first category of developers. It is much harder for amateurs or beginners to find answers to their questions by themselves, and they will reach out to you for assistance.
  * At the same time, the second category is much more sensitive to the quality of both the product and customer support, and fulfilling their requests might be non-trivial.

Finally, it is almost impossible to create an API that will suit both amateur and professional developers well within a single product. The former need maximum simplicity in implementing basic use cases, while the latter seek the ability to adapt the API to match their technological stack and development paradigms and the problems they solve usually require deep customization. We will discuss this matter in the “[API Services Range](#api-product-range)” chapter.
