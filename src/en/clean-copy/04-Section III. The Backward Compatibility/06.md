### [Interfaces as a Universal Pattern][back-compat-universal-interfaces]

Let us summarize what we have written in the three previous chapters:

  1. Extending API functionality is implemented through abstracting: the entity nomenclature is to be reinterpreted so that existing methods become partial (ideally — the most frequent) simplified cases to more general functionality.
  2. Higher-level entities are to be the informational contexts for low-level ones, i.e., don't prescribe any specific behavior but translate their state and expose functionality to modify it (directly through calling some methods or indirectly through firing events).
  3. Concrete functionality, e.g., working with “bare metal” hardware or underlying platform APIs, should be delegated to low-level entities.

**NB**. There is nothing novel about these rules: one might easily recognize them being the [SOLID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID) architecture principles. There is no surprise in that either, because SOLID concentrates on contract-oriented development, and APIs are contracts by definition. We've just added the “abstraction levels” and “informational contexts” concepts there.

However, there is an unanswered question: how should we design the entity nomenclature from the beginning so that extending the API won't make it a mess of different inconsistent methods of different ages? The answer is pretty obvious: to avoid clumsy situations while abstracting (as with the recipe properties), all the entities must be originally considered being a specific implementation of a more general interface, even if there are no planned alternative implementations for them.

For example, we should have asked ourselves a question while designing the `POST /search` API: what is a “search result”? What abstract interface does it implement? To answer this question we must neatly decompose this entity to find which facet of it is used for interacting with which objects.

Then we would have come to the understanding that a “search result” is actually a composition of two interfaces:
  * When we create an order, we need the search result to provide those fields which describe the order itself; it might be a structure like:
      
       `{coffee_machine_id, recipe_id, volume, currency_code, price}`,

       or we can encode this data in the single `offer_id`.
  
  * To have this search result displayed in the app, we need a different data set: `name`, `description`, and formatted and localized prices.

So our interface (let us call it `ISearchResult`) is actually a composition of two other interfaces: `IOrderParameters` (an entity that allows for creating an order) and `ISearchItemViewParameters` (some abstract representation of the search result in the UI). This interface split should automatically lead us to additional questions:

  1. How will we couple the former and the latter? Obviously, these two sub-interfaces are related: the machine-readable price must match the human-readable one, for example. This will naturally lead us to the “formatter” concept described in the “[Strong Coupling and Related Problems](#back-compat-strong-coupling)” chapter.

  2. And what is the “abstract representation of the search result in the UI”? Do we have other kinds of search, should the `ISearchItemViewParameters` interface be a subtype of some even more general interface, or maybe a composition of several such ones?

Replacing specific implementations with interfaces not only allows us to respond more clearly to many concerns that pop up during the API design phase but also helps us to outline many possible API evolution directions, which should help us in avoiding API inconsistency problems in the future.
