### Describing Final Interfaces

When all entities, their responsibilities, and relations to each other are defined, we proceed to the development of the API itself. We are to describe the objects, fields, methods, and functions nomenclature in detail. In this chapter, we're giving purely practical advice on making APIs usable and understandable.

An important assertion at number 0:

##### 0. Rules are just generalizations

Rules are not to be applied unconditionally. They are not making thinking redundant. Every rule has a rational reason to exist. If your situation doesn't justify following the rule — then you shouldn't do it.

For example, demanding a specification be consistent exists to help developers spare time on reading docs. If you *need* developers to read some entity's doc, it is totally rational to make its signature deliberately inconsistent.

This idea applies to every concept listed below. If you get an unusable, bulky, unobvious API because you follow the rules, it's a motive to revise the rules (or the API).

It is important to understand that you always can introduce concepts of your own. For example, some frameworks willfully reject paired `set_entity` / `get_entity` methods in a favor of a single `entity()` method, with an optional argument. The crucial part is being systematic in applying the concept. If it's rendered into life, you must apply it to every single API method, or at the very least elaborate a naming rule to discern such polymorphic methods from regular ones.

##### Explicit is always better than implicit

Entity name must explicitly tell what it does and what side effects to expect while using it.

**Bad**:  
```
// Cancels an order
GET /orders/cancellation
```
It's quite a surprise that accessing the `cancellation` resource (what is it?) with the non-modifying `GET` method actually cancels an order.

**Better**:  
```
// Cancels an order
POST /orders/cancel
```

**Bad**:
```
// Returns aggregated statistics
// since the beginning of time
GET /orders/statistics
```
Even if the operation is non-modifying but computationally expensive, you should explicitly indicate that, especially if clients got charged for computational resource usage. Even more so, default values must not be set in a manner leading to maximum resource consumption.

**Better**:
```
// Returns aggregated statistics
// for a specified period of time
POST /v1/orders/statistics/aggregate
{ "begin_date", "end_date" }
```

**Try to design function signatures to be absolutely transparent about what the function does, what arguments it takes, and what's the result**. While reading a code working with your API, it must be easy to understand what it does without reading docs.

Two important implications:

**1.1.** If the operation is modifying, it must be obvious from the signature. In particular, there might be no modifying operations using the `GET` verb.

**1.2.** If your API's nomenclature contains both synchronous and asynchronous operations, then (a)synchronicity must be apparent from signatures, **or** a naming convention must exist.

##### Specify which standards are used

Regretfully, humanity is unable to agree on the most trivial things, like which day starts the week, to say nothing about more sophisticated standards.

So *always* specify exactly which standard is applied. Exceptions are possible if you're 100% sure that only one standard for this entity exists in the world, and every person on Earth is totally aware of it.

**Bad**: `"date": "11/12/2020"` — there are tons of date formatting standards; you can't even tell which number means the day number and which number means the month.

**Better**: `"iso_date": "2020-11-12"`.
  
**Bad**: `"duration": 5000` — five thousand of what?

**Better**:  
    `"duration_ms": 5000`  
    or  
    `"duration": "5000ms"`  
    or  
    `"duration": {"unit": "ms", "value": 5000}`.

One particular implication of this rule is that money sums must *always* be accompanied by a currency code.

It is also worth saying that in some areas the situation with standards is so spoiled that, whatever you do, someone got upset. A ‘classical’ example is geographical coordinates order (latitude-longitude vs longitude-latitude). Alas, the only working method of fighting frustration there is the ‘Serenity Notepad’ to be discussed in Section II.

##### Keep fractional numbers precision intact

If the protocol allows, fractional numbers with fixed precision (like money sums) must be represented as a specially designed type like Decimal or its equivalent.

If there is no Decimal type in the protocol (for instance, JSON doesn't have one), you should either use integers (e.g. apply a fixed multiplicator) or strings.

##### Entities must have concrete names

Avoid single amoeba-like words, such as ‘get’, ‘apply’, ‘make’.

**Bad**: `user.get()` — hard to guess what is actually returned.

**Better**: `user.get_id()`.

##### Don't spare the letters

In the 21st century, there's no need to shorten entities' names.

**Bad**: `order.time()` — unclear, what time is actually returned: order creation time, order preparation time, order waiting time?…

**Better**: `order.get_estimated_delivery_time()`

**Bad**:
```
// Returns a pointer to the first occurrence
// in str1 of any of the characters
// that are part of str2
strpbrk (str1, str2)
```

Possibly, an author of this API thought that the `pbrk` abbreviature would mean something to readers; clearly mistaken. Also, it's hard to tell from the signature which string (`str1` or `str2`) stands for a character set.

**Better**: `str_search_for_characters (lookup_character_set, str)`  
— though it's highly disputable whether this function should exist at all; a feature-rich search function would be much more convenient. Also, shortening a `string` to an `str` bears no practical sense, regretfully being a routine in many subject areas.

##### Naming implies typing

Field named `recipe` must be of a `Recipe` type. Field named `recipe_id` must contain a recipe identifier that we could find within the `Recipe` entity.

Same for primitive types. Arrays must be named in a plural form or as collective nouns, i.e. `objects`, `children`. If that's impossible, better add a prefix or a postfix to avoid doubt.

**Bad**: `GET /news` — unclear whether a specific news item is returned, or a list of them.

**Better**: `GET /news-list`.

Similarly, if a Boolean value is expected, entity naming must describe some qualitative state, i.e. `is_ready`, `open_now`.

**Bad**: `"task.status": true`  
— statuses are not explicitly binary; also such API isn't extendable.

**Better**: `"task.is_finished": true`.

Specific platforms imply specific additions to this rule with regard to the first-class citizen types they provide. For example, entities of the `Date` type (if such type is present) would benefit from being indicated with `_at` or `_date` postfixes, i.e. `created_at`, `occurred_at`.

If an entity name is a polysemantic term itself, which could confuse developers, better add an extra prefix or postfix to avoid misunderstanding.

**Bad**:
```
// Returns a list of coffee machine builtin functions
GET /coffee-machines/{id}/functions
```
Word ‘function’ is many-valued. It could mean built-in functions, but also ‘a piece of code’, or a state (machine is functioning).

**Better**: `GET /v1/coffee-machines/{id}/builtin-functions-list`

##### Matching entities must have matching names and behave alike

**Bad**: `begin_transition` / `stop_transition`  
— `begin` and `stop` terms don't match; developers will have to dig into the docs.

**Better**: either `begin_transition` / `end_transition` or `start_transition` / `stop_transition`.

**Bad**:  
```
// Find the position of the first occurrence
// of a substring in a string
strpos(haystack, needle)
```
```
// Replace all occurrences
// of the search string with the replacement string
str_replace(needle, replace, haystack)
```
Several rules are violated:
  * inconsistent underscore using;
  * functionally close methods have different `needle`/`haystack` argument ordering;
  * the first function finds the first occurrence while the second one finds them all, and there is no way to deduce that fact out of the function signatures.

We're leaving the exercise of making these signatures better to the reader.

##### Use globally unique identifiers

It's considered a good form to use globally unique strings as entity identifiers, either semantic (i.e. "lungo" for beverage types) or random ones (i.e. [UUID-4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier#Version_4_(random))). It might turn out to be extremely useful if you need to merge data from several sources under a single identifier.

In general, we tend to advise using urn-like identifiers, e.g. `urn:order:<uuid>` (or just `order:<uuid>`). That helps a lot in dealing with legacy systems with different identifiers attached to the same entity. Namespaces in urns help to understand quickly which identifier is used and is there a usage mistake.

One important implication: **never use increasing numbers as external identifiers**. Apart from the abovementioned reasons, it allows counting how many entities of each type there are in the system. Your competitors will be able to calculate a precise number of orders you have each day, for example.

**NB**: in this book, we often use short identifiers like "123" in code examples; that's for reading the book on small screens convenience. Do not replicate this practice in a real-world API.

##### The system state must be observable by clients

This rule could be reformulated as ‘don't make clients guess’.

**Bad**:
```
// Creates an order and returns its id
POST /v1/orders
{ … }
→
{ "order_id" }
```
```
// Returns an order by its id
GET /v1/orders/{id}
// The order isn't confirmed
// and awaits checking
→ 404 Not Found
```
— though the operation looks to be executed successfully, the client must store the order id and recurrently check the `GET /v1/orders/{id}` state. This pattern is bad per se, but gets even worse when we consider two cases:

  * clients might lose the id, if system failure happened in between sending the request and getting the response, or if app data storage was damaged or cleansed;
  * customers can't use another device; in fact, the knowledge of orders being created is bound to a specific user agent.

In both cases, customers might consider order creating failed, and make a duplicate order, with all the consequences to be blamed on you.

**Better**:
```
// Creates an order and returns it
POST /v1/orders
{ <order parameters> }
→
{
  "order_id",
  // The order is created in explicit
  // «checking» status
  "status": "checking",
  …
}
```
```
// Returns an order by its id
GET /v1/orders/{id}
→
{ "order_id", "status" … }
```
```
// Returns all customer's orders
// in all statuses
GET /v1/users/{id}/orders
```

##### Avoid double negations

**Bad**: `"dont_call_me": false`  
— humans are bad at perceiving double negation; make mistakes.

**Better**: `"prohibit_calling": true` or `"avoid_calling": true`  
— it's easier to read, though you shouldn't deceive yourself. Avoid semantical double negations, even if you've found a ‘negative’ word without a ‘negative’ prefix.

Also worth mentioning that making mistakes in the [de Morgan's laws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Morgan's_laws) usage is even simpler. For example, if you have two flags:

```
GET /coffee-machines/{id}/stocks
→
{
  "has_beans": true,
  "has_cup": true
}
```

‘Coffee might be prepared’ condition would look like `has_beans && has_cup` — both flags must be true. However, if you provide the negations of both flags:

```
{
  "beans_absence": false,
  "cup_absence": false
}
```
— then developers will have to evaluate one of the `!beans_absence && !cup_absence` ⇔ `!(beans_absence || cup_absence)` conditions, and in this transition, people tend to make mistakes. Avoiding double negations helps little, and regretfully only general advice could be given: avoid the situations when developers have to evaluate such flags.

##### Avoid implicit type conversion

This advice is opposite to the previous one, ironically. When developing APIs you frequently need to add a new optional field with a non-empty default value. For example:

```
POST /v1/orders
{}
→
{
  "contactless_delivery": true
}
```

This new `contactless_delivery` option isn't required, but its default value is `true`. A question arises: how developers should discern explicit intention to abolish the option (`false`) from knowing not it exists (field isn't set). They have to write something like:

```
if (Type(order.contactless_delivery) == 'Boolean' &&
    order.contactless_delivery == false) { … }
```

This practice makes the code more complicated, and it's quite easy to make mistakes, which will effectively treat the field in a quite opposite manner. The same could happen if some special values (i.e. `null` or `-1`) to denote value absence are used.

The universal rule to deal with such situations is to make all new Boolean flags false by default.


**Better**
```
POST /v1/orders
{}
→
{
  "force_contact_delivery": false
}
```

If a non-Boolean field with specially treated value absence is to be introduced, then introduce two fields.

**Bad**:
```
// Creates a user
POST /users
{ … }
→
// Users are created with a monthly
// spending limit set by default
{
  …
  "spending_monthly_limit_usd": "100"
}
// To cancel the limit null value is used
POST /users
{ 
  …
  "spending_monthly_limit_usd": null
}
```

**Better**
```
POST /users
{
  // true — user explicitly cancels
  //   monthly spending limit
  // false — limit isn't canceled
  //   (default value)
  "abolish_spending_limit": false,
  // Non-required field
  // Only present if the previous flag
  // is set to false
  "spending_monthly_limit_usd": "100",
  …
}
```

**NB**: the contradiction with the previous rule lies in the necessity of introducing ‘negative’ flags (the ‘no limit’ flag), which we had to rename to `abolish_spending_limit`. Though it's a decent name for a negative flag, its semantics is still unobvious, and developers will have to read the docs. That's the way.

##### Avoid implicit partial updates

**Bad**:
```
// Return the order state
// by its id
GET /v1/orders/123
→
{
  "order_id",
  "delivery_address",
  "client_phone_number",
  "client_phone_number_ext",
  "updated_at"
}
// Partially rewrites the order
PATCH /v1/orders/123
{ "delivery_address" }
→
{ "delivery_address" }
```
— this approach is usually chosen to lessen request and response body sizes, plus it allows for the implementation of collaborative editing cheaply. Both these advantages are imaginary.

**First**, sparing bytes on semantic data is seldom needed in modern apps. Network packet sizes (MTU, Maximum Transmission Unit) are more than a kilobyte right now; shortening responses is useless while they're less than a kilobyte.

Excessive network traffic usually occurs if:

  * no data pagination is provided;
  * no limits on field values are set;
  * binary data is transmitted (graphics, audio, video, etc.)

Transferring only a subset of fields solves none of these problems, in the best case just masks them. A more viable approach comprises:

  * making separate endpoints for ‘heavy’ data;
  * introducing pagination and field value length limits;
  * stopping saving bytes in all other cases.

**Second**, shortening response sizes will backfire exactly with spoiling collaborative editing: one client won't see the changes the other client has made. Generally speaking, in 9 cases out of 10, it is better to return a full entity state from any modifying operation, sharing the format with the read-access endpoint. Actually, you should always do this unless response size affects performance.

**Third**, this approach might work if you need to rewrite a field's value. But how to unset the field, e.g. to return its value to the default state? For example, how to *remove* the `client_phone_number_ext`?

In such cases, special values are often being used, for example, a `null` one. But as we discussed above, this is a defective practice. Another variant is prohibiting non-required fields, but that would pose considerable obstacles in a way of expanding the API.

**Better**: one of the following two strategies might be used.

**Option \#1**: splitting the endpoints. Editable fields are grouped and taken out as separate endpoints. This approach also matches well against [the decomposition principle](#chapter-10) we discussed in the previous chapter.

```
// Return the order state
// by its id
GET /v1/orders/123
→
{
  "order_id",
  "delivery_details": {
    "address"
  },
  "client_details": {
    "phone_number",
    "phone_number_ext"
  },
  "updated_at"
}
// Fully rewrite order delivery options
PUT /v1/orders/123/delivery-details
{ "address" }
// Fully rewrite order customer data
PUT /v1/orders/123/client-details
{ "phone_number" }
```

Omitting the `client_phone_number_ext` in the `PUT client-details` request would be sufficient to remove it. This approach also helps to separate constant and calculated fields (`order_id` and `updated_at`) from editable ones, thus getting rid of ambiguous situations (what happens if a client tries to rewrite the `updated_at` field?). You may also return the entire `order` entity from `PUT` endpoints (however, there should be some naming convention for that).

**Option 2**: design a format for atomic changes.

```
POST /v1/order/changes
X-Idempotency-Token: <see next paragraph>
{
  "changes": [{
    "type": "set",
    "field": "delivery_address",
    "value": <new value>
  }, {
    "type": "unset",
    "field": "client_phone_number_ext"
  }]
}
```

This approach is much harder to implement, but it's the only viable method to implement collaborative editing since it explicitly reflects what a user was actually doing with entity representation. With data exposed in such a format, you might actually implement offline editing, when user changes are accumulated and then sent at once, while the server automatically resolves conflicts by ‘rebasing’ the changes.

##### All API operations must be idempotent

Let us recall that idempotency is the following property: repeated calls to the same function with the same parameters don't change the resource state. Since we're discussing client-server interaction in the first place, repeating requests in case of network failure isn't an exception, but a norm of life.

If the endpoint's idempotency can't be assured naturally, explicit idempotency parameters must be added, in a form of either a token or a resource version.

**Bad**:
```
// Creates an order
POST /orders
```
A second order will be produced if the request is repeated!

**Better**:
```
// Creates an order
POST /v1/orders
X-Idempotency-Token: <random string>
```
A client on its side must retain the `X-Idempotency-Token` in case of automated endpoint retrying. A server on its side must check whether an order created with this token exists.

**An alternative**:
```
// Creates order draft
POST /v1/orders/drafts
→
{ "draft_id" }
```
```
// Confirms the draft
PUT /v1/orders/drafts/{draft_id}
{ "confirmed": true }
```

Creating order drafts is a non-binding operation since it doesn't entail any consequences, so it's fine to create drafts without the idempotency token.

Confirming drafts is a naturally idempotent operation, with the `draft_id` being its idempotency key.

Also worth mentioning that adding idempotency tokens to naturally idempotent handlers isn't meaningless either, since it allows to distinguish two situations:
  * a client didn't get the response because of some network issues, and is now repeating the request;
  * a client's mistaken, trying to make conflicting changes.

Consider the following example: imagine there is a shared resource, characterized by a revision number, and a client tries updating it.
```
POST /resource/updates
{
  "resource_revision": 123
  "updates"
}
```
The server retrieves the actual resource revision and finds it to be 124. How to respond correctly? `409 Conflict` might be returned, but then the client will be forced to understand the nature of the conflict and somehow resolve it, potentially confusing the user. It's also unwise to fragment the conflict resolving algorithm, allowing each client to implement it independently.

The server may compare request bodies, assuming that identical `updates` values mean retrying, but this assumption might be dangerously wrong (for example if the resource is a counter of some kind, then repeating identical requests are routine).

Adding the idempotency token (either directly as a random string, or indirectly in a form of drafts) solves this problem.
```
POST /resource/updates
X-Idempotency-Token: <token>
{
  "resource_revision": 123
  "updates"
}
→ 201 Created
```
— the server found out that the same token was used in creating revision 124, which means the client is retrying the request.

Or:
```
POST /resource/updates
X-Idempotency-Token: <token>
{
  "resource_revision": 123
  "updates"
}
→ 409 Conflict
```
— the server found out that a different token was used in creating revision 124, which means an access conflict.

Furthermore, adding idempotency tokens not only resolves the issue but also makes advanced optimizations possible. If the server detects an access conflict, it could try to resolve it, ‘rebasing’ the update like modern version control systems do, and return a `200 OK` instead of a `409 Conflict`. This logic dramatically improves user experience, being fully backwards compatible, and helps to avoid conflict resolving code fragmentation.

Also, be warned: clients are bad at implementing idempotency tokens. Two problems are common:
  * you can't really expect that clients generate truly random tokens — they may share the same seed or simply use weak algorithms or entropy sources; therefore you must put constraints on token checking: token must be unique to a specific user and resource, not globally;
  * clients tend to misunderstand the concept and either generate new tokens each time they repeat the request (which deteriorates the UX, but otherwise healthy) or conversely use one token in several requests (not healthy at all and could lead to catastrophic disasters; another reason to implement the suggestion in the previous clause); writing detailed doc and/or client library is highly recommended.

##### Avoid non-atomic operations

There is a common problem with implementing the changes list approach: what to do if some changes were successfully applied, while others are not? The rule is simple: if you may ensure the atomicity (e.g. either apply all changes or none of them) — do it.

**Bad**:
```
// Returns a list of recipes
GET /v1/recipes
→
{
  "recipes": [{
    "id": "lungo",
    "volume": "200ml"
  }, {
    "id": "latte",
    "volume": "300ml"
  }]
}
// Changes recipes' parameters
PATCH /v1/recipes
{
  "changes": [{
    "id": "lungo",
    "volume": "300ml"
  }, {
    "id": "latte",
    "volume": "-1ml"
  }]
}
→ 400 Bad Request
// Re-reading the list
GET /v1/recipes
→
{
  "recipes": [{
    "id": "lungo",
    // This value changed
    "volume": "300ml"
  }, {
    "id": "latte",
    // and this did not
    "volume": "300ml"
  }]
}
```
— there is no way how the client might learn that failed operation was actually partially applied. Even if there is an indication of this fact in the response, the client still cannot tell, whether lungo volume changed because of the request, or some other client changed it.

If you can't guarantee the atomicity of an operation, you should elaborate in detail on how to deal with it. There must be a separate status for each individual change.

**Better**:
```
PATCH /v1/recipes
{
  "changes": [{
    "recipe_id": "lungo",
    "volume": "300ml"
  }, {
    "recipe_id": "latte",
    "volume": "-1ml"
  }]
}
// You may actually return
// a ‘partial success’ status
// if the protocol allows it
→ 200 OK
{
  "changes": [{
    "change_id",
    "occurred_at",
    "recipe_id": "lungo",
    "status": "success"
  }, {
    "change_id",
    "occurred_at",
    "recipe_id": "latte",
    "status": "fail",
    "error"
  }]
}
```

Here:
  * the `change_id` field is a unique identifier of each atomic change;
  * the `occurred_at` field is a moment of time when the change was actually applied;
  * the `error` field contains the error data related to the specific change.

Might be of use:
  * introducing `sequence_id` parameters in the request to guarantee execution order and to align item order in response with the requested one;
  * expose a separate `/changes-history` endpoint for clients to get the history of applied changes even if the app crashed while getting a partial success response or there was a network timeout.

Non-atomic changes are undesirable because they erode the idempotency concept. Let's take a look at the example:

```
PATCH /v1/recipes
{
  "idempotency_token",
  "changes": [{
    "recipe_id": "lungo",
    "volume": "300ml"
  }, {
    "recipe_id": "latte",
    "volume": "400ml"
  }]
}
→ 200 OK
{
  "changes": [{
    …
    "status": "success"
  }, {
    …
    "status": "fail",
    "error": {
      "reason": "too_many_requests"
    }
  }]
}
```

Imagine the client failed to get a response because of a network error, and it repeats the request:

```
PATCH /v1/recipes
{
  "idempotency_token",
  "changes": [{
    "recipe_id": "lungo",
    "volume": "300ml"
  }, {
    "recipe_id": "latte",
    "volume": "400ml"
  }]
}
→ 200 OK
{
  "changes": [{
    …
    "status": "success"
  }, {
    …
    "status": "success",
  }]
}
```

To the client, everything looks normal: changes were applied, and the last response got is always actual. But the resource state after the first request was inherently different from the resource state after the second one, which contradicts the very definition of ‘idempotency’.

It would be more correct if the server did nothing upon getting the second request with the same idempotency token, and returned the same status list breakdown. But it implies that storing these breakdowns must be implemented.

Just in case: nested operations must be idempotent themselves. If they are not, separate idempotency tokens must be generated for each nested operation.

##### Specify caching policies

Client-server interaction usually implies that network and server resources are limited, therefore caching operation results on client devices is standard practice.

So it's highly desirable to make caching options clear, if not from functions' signatures then at least from docs.

**Bad**:
```
// Returns lungo price in cafes
// closest to the specified location
GET /price?recipe=lungo
  &longitude={longitude}&latitude={latitude}
→
{ "currency_code", "price" }
```
Two questions arise:
  * until when the price is valid?
  * in what vicinity of the location the price is valid?

**Better**: you may use standard protocol capabilities to denote cache options, like the `Cache-Control` header. If you need caching in both temporal and spatial dimensions, you should do something like that:
```

##### Pagination, filtration, and cursors

Any endpoints returning data collections must be paginated. No exclusions exist.

Any paginated endpoint must provide an interface to iterate over all the data.

**Bad**:
```
// Returns a limited number of records
// sorted by creation date
// starting with a record with an index
// equals to `offset`
GET /v1/records?limit=10&offset=100
```

At the first glance, this is the most standard way of organizing the pagination in APIs. But let's ask some questions to ourselves.  
  1. How clients could learn about new records being added at the beginning of the list?
    Obviously, a client could only retry the initial request (`offset=0`) and compare identifiers to those it already knows. But what if the number of new records exceeds the `limit`? Imagine the situation:
      * the client process records sequentially;
      * some problem occurred, and a batch of new records awaits processing;
      * the client requests new records (`offset=0`) but can't find any known records on the first page;
      * the client continues iterating over records page by page until it finds the last known identifier; all this time the order processing is idle;
      * the client might never start processing, being preoccupied with chaotic page requests to restore records sequence.
  2. What happens if some record is deleted from the head of the list?  
    Easy: the client will miss one record and will never learn this.
  3. What cache parameters to set for this endpoint?  
    None could be set: repeating the request with the same `limit` and `offset` parameters each time produces a new record set.

**Better**: in such unidirectional lists the pagination must use the key that implies the order. Like this:
```
// Returns a limited number of records
// sorted by creation date
// starting with a record with an identifier
// following the specified one
GET /v1/records?older_than={record_id}&limit=10
// Returns a limited number of records
// sorted by creation date
// starting with a record with an identifier
// preceding the specified one
GET /v1/records?newer_than={record_id}&limit=10
```
With the pagination organized like that, clients never bother about records being added or removed in the processed part of the list: they continue to iterate over the records, either getting new ones (using `newer_than`) or older ones (using `older_than`). If there is no record removal operation, clients may easily cache responses — the URL will always return the same record set.

Another way to organize such lists is returning a `cursor` to be used instead of the `record_id`, making interfaces more versatile.
```
// Initial data request
POST /v1/records/list
{
  // Some additional filtering options
  "filter": {
    "category": "some_category",
    "created_date": {
      "older_than": "2020-12-07"
    }
  }
}
→
{
  "cursor"
}
```
```
// Follow-up requests
GET /v1/records?cursor=<cursor value>
{ "records", "cursor" }
```
One advantage of this approach is the possibility to keep initial request parameters (i.e. the `filter` in our example) embedded into the cursor itself, thus not copying them in follow-up requests. It might be especially actual if the initial request prepares the full dataset, for example, moving it from the ‘cold’ storage to a ‘hot’ one (then the `cursor` might simply contain the encoded dataset id and the offset).

There are several approaches to implementing cursors (for example, making a single endpoint for initial and follow-up requests, returning the first data portion in the first response). As usual, the crucial part is maintaining consistency across all such endpoints.

**NB**: some sources discourage this approach because in this case user can't see a list of all pages and can't choose an arbitrary one. We should note here that:
  * such a case (pages list and page selection) exists if we deal with user interfaces; we could hardly imagine a *program* interface that needs to provide access to random data pages;
  * if we still talk about an API to some application, which has a ‘paging’ user control, then a proper approach would be to prepare ‘paging’ data on the server side, including generating links to pages;
  * cursor-based solutions don't prohibit using the `offset`/`limit` parameters; nothing could prevent us from creating a dual interface, which might serve both `GET /items?cursor=…` and `GET /items?offset=…&limit=…` requests;
  * finally, if there is a necessity to provide access to arbitrary pages in the user interface, we should ask ourselves a question, which problem is being solved that way; probably, users use this functionality to find something: a specific element on the list, or the position they ended while working with the list last time; probably, we should provide more convenient controls to solve those tasks than accessing data pages by their indexes.

**Bad**:
```
// Returns a limited number of records
// sorted by a specified field in a specified order
// starting with a record with an index
// equals to `offset`
GET /records?sort_by=date_modified&sort_order=desc&limit=10&offset=100
```

Sorting by the date of modification usually means that data might be modified. In other words, some records might change after the first data chunk is returned, but before the next chunk is requested. Modified records will simply disappear from the listing because of moving to the first page. Clients will never get those records that were changed during the iteration process, even if the cursor-based scheme is implemented, and they never learn the sheer fact of such an omission. Also, this particular interface isn't extendable as there is no way to add sorting by two or more fields.

**Better**: there is no general solution to this problem in this formulation. Listing records by modification time will always be unpredictably volatile, so we have to change the approach itself; we have two options.

**Option one**: fix the records ordering at the moment we've got the initial request, e.g. our server produces the entire list and stores it in the immutable form:

```
// Creates a view based on the parameters passed
POST /v1/record-views
{
  sort_by: [
    { "field": "date_modified", "order": "desc" }
  ]
}
→
{ "id", "cursor" }
```
```
// Returns a portion of the view
GET /v1/record-views/{id}?cursor={cursor}
```

Since the produced view is immutable, access to it might be organized in any form, including a limit-offset scheme, cursors, `Range` header, etc. However, there is a downside: records modified after the view was generated will be misplaced or outdated.

**Option two**: guarantee a strict records order, for example, by introducing a concept of record change events:

```
POST /v1/records/modified/list
{
  // Optional
  "cursor"
}
→
{
  "modified": [
    { "date", "record_id" }
  ],
  "cursor"
}
```

This scheme's downsides are the necessity to create separate indexed event storage, and the multiplication of data items, since for a single record many events might exist.

##### Errors must be informative

While writing the code developers face problems, many of them quite trivial, like invalid parameter types or some boundary violations. The more convenient are the error responses your API return, the less is the amount of time developers waste struggling with it, and the more comfortable is working with the API.

**Bad**:
```
POST /v1/coffee-machines/search
{
  "recipes": ["lngo"],
  "position": {
    "latitude": 110,
    "longitude": 55
  }
}
→ 400 Bad Request
{}
```
— of course, the mistakes (typo in the `"lngo"`, wrong coordinates) are obvious. But the handler checks them anyway, why not return readable descriptions?

**Better**:
```
{
  "reason": "wrong_parameter_value",
  "localized_message":
    "Something is wrong. Contact the developer of the app."
  "details": {
    "checks_failed": [
      {
        "field": "recipe",
        "error_type": "wrong_value",
        "message":
          "Unknown value: 'lngo'. Did you mean 'lungo'?"
      },
      {
        "field": "position.latitude",
        "error_type": "constraint_violation",
        "constraints": {
          "min": -90,
          "max": 90
        },
        "message":
          "'position.latitude' value must fall within [-90, 90] interval"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```
It is also a good practice to return all detectable errors at once to spare developers' time.

##### Maintain a proper error sequence

**First**, always return unresolvable errors before the resolvable ones:

```
POST /v1/orders
{
  "recipe": "lngo",
  "offer"
}
→ 409 Conflict
{
  "reason": "offer_expired"
}
// Request repeats
// with the renewed offer
POST /v1/orders
{
  "recipe": "lngo",
  "offer"
}
→ 400 Bad Request
{
  "reason": "recipe_unknown"
}
```
— what was the point of renewing the offer if the order cannot be created anyway?

**Second**, maintain such a sequence of unresolvable errors which leads to a minimal amount of customers' and developers' irritation.

**Bad**:
```
POST /v1/orders
{
  "items": [{ "item_id": "123", "price": "0.10" }]
}
→
409 Conflict
{
  "reason": "price_changed",
  "details": [{ "item_id": "123", "actual_price": "0.20" }]
}
// Request repeats
// with an actual price
POST /v1/orders
{
  "items": [{ "item_id": "123", "price": "0.20" }]
}
→
409 Conflict
{
  "reason": "order_limit_exceeded",
  "localized_message": "Order limit exceeded"
}
```
— what was the point of showing the price changed dialog, if the user still can't make an order, even if the price is right? When one of the concurrent orders finishes, and the user is able to commit another one, prices, items availability, and other order parameters will likely need another correction.

**Third**, draw a chart: which error resolution might lead to the emergence of another one. Otherwise, you might eventually return the same error several times, or worse, make a cycle of errors.

```
// Create an order
// with a payed delivery
POST /v1/orders
{
  "items": 3,
  "item_price": "3000.00"
  "currency_code": "MNT",
  "delivery_fee": "1000.00",
  "total": "10000.00"
}
→ 409 Conflict
// Error: if the order sum
// is more than 9000 tögrögs, 
// delivery must be free
{
  "reason": "delivery_is_free"
}
// Create an order
// with a free delivery
POST /v1/orders
{
  "items": 3,
  "item_price": "3000.00"
  "currency_code": "MNT",
  "delivery_fee": "0.00",
  "total": "9000.00"
}
→ 409 Conflict
// Error: minimal order sum
// is 10000 tögrögs
{
  "reason": "below_minimal_sum",
  "currency_code": "MNT",
  "minimal_sum": "10000.00"
}
```

You may note that in this setup the error can't be resolved in one step: this situation must be elaborated over, and either order calculation parameters must be changed (discounts should not be counted against the minimal order sum), or a special type of error must be introduced.

##### Stipulate future restrictions

With the API popularity growth, it will inevitably become necessary to introduce technical means of preventing illicit API usage, such as displaying captcha, setting honeypots, raising the ‘too many requests’ exceptions, installing anti-DDoS proxies, etc. All these things cannot be done if the corresponding errors and messages were not described in the docs from the very beginning.

You are not obliged to actually generate those exceptions, but you might stipulate this possibility in the terms of service. For example, you might describe the `429 Too Many Requests` error or captcha redirect, but implement the functionality when it's actually needed.

It is extremely important to leave a room for multi-factored authentication (such as TOTP, SMS, or 3D-secure-like technologies) in case it's possible to make payments through the API. In this case, it's a must have from the very beginning.

##### No results is a result

If a server processed a request correctly and no exceptional situation occurred — there must be no error. Regretfully, an antipattern is widespread — of throwing errors when zero results are found.

**Bad**
```
POST /search
{
  "query": "lungo",
  "location": <customer's location>
}
→ 404 Not Found
{
  "localized_message":
    "No one makes lungo nearby"
}
```

`4xx` statuses imply that a client made a mistake. But no mistakes were made by either a customer or a developer: a client cannot know whether the lungo is served in this location beforehand.

**Better**:
```
POST /search
{
  "query": "lungo",
  "location": <customer's location>
}
→ 200 OK
{
  "results": []
}
```

This rule might be reduced to: if an array is the result of the operation, then the emptiness of that array is not a mistake, but a correct response. (Of course, if an empty array is acceptable semantically; an empty array of coordinates is a mistake for sure.)

##### Localization and internationalization

All endpoints must accept language parameters (for example, in a form of the `Accept-Language` header), even if they are not being used currently.

It is important to understand that the user's language and the user's jurisdiction are different things. Your API working cycle must always store the user's location. It might be stated either explicitly (requests contain geographical coordinates) or implicitly (initial location-bound request initiates session creation which stores the location), but no correct localization is possible in absence of location data. In most cases reducing the location to just a country code is enough.

The thing is that lots of parameters potentially affecting data formats depend not on language, but on a user's location. To name a few: number formatting (integer and fractional part delimiter, digit groups delimiter), date formatting, the first day of the week, keyboard layout, measurement units system (which might be non-decimal!), etc. In some situations, you need to store two locations: user residence location and user ‘viewport’. For example, if a US citizen is planning a European trip, it's convenient to show prices in local currency, but measure distances in miles and feet.

Sometimes explicit location passing is not enough since there are lots of territorial conflicts in the world. How the API should behave when user coordinates lie within disputed regions is a legal matter, regretfully. The author of this book once had to implement a ‘state A territory according to state B official position’ concept.

**Important**: mark a difference between localization for end users and localization for developers. Take a look at the example in rule \#19: `localized_message` is meant for the user; the app should show it if there is no specific handler for this error exists in code. This message must be written in the user's language and formatted according to the user's location. But the `details.checks_failed[].message` is meant to be read by developers examining the problem. So it must be written and formatted in a manner that suits developers best. In the software development world, it usually means ‘in English’.

Worth mentioning is that the `localized_` prefix in the example is used to differentiate messages to users from messages to developers. A concept like that must be, of course, explicitly stated in your API docs.

And one more thing: all strings must be UTF-8, no exclusions.
