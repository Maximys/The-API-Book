# [Читать книгу ‘The API’ Сергея Константинова](https://twirl.github.io/The-API-Book/index.ru.html)

This is the working repository for ‘The API’ book written by Sergey Konstantinov ([email](mailto:twirl-team@yandex.ru), [Linkedin profile](https://linkedin.com/in/twirl)).

## Current State and the Roadmap

Right now all three section (‘The API Design’, ‘The Backwards Compatibility’, and ‘The API Product’) are finished. So the book is basically ready, I'm working on some cosmetics:

  * adding readable schemes where it's appropriate;
  * refactoring the ‘Describing Final Interfaces’ chapters;
  * rephrasing and expanding the chapters on versioning and identifying users.

I also have more distant plans on adding two more subsections to Section I.
  * Section Ia ‘JSON HTTP APIs’:
    * the REST myth;
    * following HTTP spec, including those parts where you should not follow the spec;
    * best practices;
  * Section Ib ‘SDK Design’ covering more tricky issues of having proving UI alongside the API (no specific plan right now)

## Translation

I am translating new chapters into English at the moment they're ready. I'm not a native speaker, so feel free to correct my grammar.

## Contributing

I am accepting inquiries. Feel free to open issues.

I am NOT accepting pull requests introducing any new content, since I'm willing to be the only author. I would gratefully accept typo fixes, though.
