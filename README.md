# [Читать книгу ‘The API’ Сергея Константинова](https://twirl.github.io/The-API-Book/index.ru.html)

This is the working repository for ‘The API’ book written by Sergey Konstantinov ([email](mailto:twirl-team@yandex.ru), [Linkedin profile](https://linkedin.com/in/twirl)).

## Current State and the Roadmap

Right now Section I (‘API Design’) and Section II (‘Backwards Compatibility’) are finished. The Sections are lacking readable schemes, I'll draw them later.

Section III ‘API as a Product’ will be discussing non-technical issues
  * what for the APIs exist;
  * monetizing APIs;
  * making sure you understand users' needs and collect proper metrics;
  * common practices, including AA issues and fraud problems;
  * organizing docs portal;
  * open source and community.

I also have more distant plans on adding two more subsections to Section I.
  * Section Ia ‘JSON HTTP APIs’:
    * the REST myth;
    * following HTTP spec, including those parts where you should not follow the spec;
    * best practices;
  * Section Ib ‘SDK Design’ covering more tricky issues of having proving UI alongside the API (no specific plan right now)

## Translation

I am translating new chapters into English at the moment they're ready. I'm not a native speaker, so feel free to correct my grammar.

## Contributing

I am accepting inquiries. Feel free to open issues.

I am NOT accepting pull requests introducing any new content, since I'm willing to be the only author. I would gratefully accept typo fixes, though.
