# The API Book

This is the working repository for ‘The API’ book written by Sergey Konstantinov ([email](mailto:twirl-team@yandex.ru), [Linkedin profile](https://linkedin.com/in/twirl)).

Designing APIs is a very special skill: API is a multiplier to both your opportunities and mistakes. This book is written to share the expertise and describe the best practices in the API design. In Section I, we'll discuss designing APIs as a concept: how to build the architecture properly, from high-level planning down to final interfaces. Section II is dedicated to expanding existing APIs in a backwards-compatible manner.

You may find `.html`, `.epub` or `.pdf` version of the book in the `docs` folder, or read it online.

Also, the [Kindle version](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09RHH44S5/ref=dbs_a_def_rwt_hsch_vapi_tkin_p1_i0) (priced at 6$) exists, though I have to warn you that its formatting suffers because of Amazon epub conversion oddities.

Pre-compiled books above comprise clean-copy texts only. Drafts could be found in the `src` folder. Complete new chapter drafts will be published on:
  * my [medium](https://twirl.medium.com/) blog in English;
  * my [habr](https://habr.com/ru/users/forgotten/posts/) blog in Russian.

I'd appreciate if you share them on reddit, for I personally can't do that: reddit bans me for ‘self-promotion’.

## Current State and the Roadmap

Right now Section I (‘API Design’) and Section II (‘Backwards Compatibility’) are finished. The Sections are lacking readable schemes, I'll draw them later.

Section III ‘API as a Product’ will be discussing non-technical issues
  * what for the APIs exist;
  * monetizing APIs;
  * making sure you understand users' needs and collect proper metrics;
  * common practices, including AA issues and fraud problems;
  * organizing docs portal;
  * open source and community.

I also have more distant plans on adding two more subsections to Section I.
  * Section Ia ‘JSON HTTP APIs’:
    * the REST myth;
    * following HTTP spec, including those parts where you should not follow the spec;
    * best practices;
  * Section Ib ‘SDK Design’ covering more tricky issues of having proving UI alongside the API (no specific plan right now)

I am translating new chapters into English at the moment they're ready. I'm not a native speaker, so feel free to correct my grammar.
