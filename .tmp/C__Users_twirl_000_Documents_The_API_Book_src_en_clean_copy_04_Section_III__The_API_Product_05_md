In that sense, API ‘sells’ just like any other kind of software.</p>\n<p>As a rule, the farther some industry sector is from information technologies, the more enthusiastic its representatives are about your API features, and the less the chance is that this enthusiasm will be converted into a real integration. The one thing that should help the case is extensive work with the community (see the corresponding chapter) that will result in establishing a circle of freelances and outsourcers eager to help non-IT businesses with integrations. You might help develop this market by the creation of educational courses and issuing certificates proving the bearer's skills of working with your API (or some broader layer of technology).</p>\n<p>Market research and getting feedback from business owners work similarly. Those businesses that are far from IT usually can't formulate their demands, so you should be rather creative (and critical-minded) while analyzing the gathered data.</p>"}
