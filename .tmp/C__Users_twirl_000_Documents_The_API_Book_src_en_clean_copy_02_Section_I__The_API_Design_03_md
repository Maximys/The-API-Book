Separating Abstraction Levels"},"messages":[],"history":[],"cwd":"C:\\Users\\twirl_000\\Documents\\The-API-Book","value":"\n<p>‘Separate abstraction levels in your code’ is possibly the most general advice to software developers. However, we don't think it would be a grave exaggeration to say that abstraction levels separation is also the most difficult task for API developers.</p>\n<p>Before proceeding to the theory, we should formulate clearly <em>why</em> abstraction levels are so important, and what goals we're trying to achieve by separating them.</p>\n<p>Let us remember that software product is a medium connecting two outstanding contexts, thus transforming terms and operations belonging to one subject area into another area's concepts. The more these areas differ, the more interim connecting links we have to introduce.</p>\n<p>Back to our coffee example. What entity abstraction levels do we see?</p>\n<ol>\n<li>We're preparing an <code>order</code> via the API: one (or more) cups of coffee, and receive payments for this.</li>\n<li>Each cup of coffee is prepared according to some <code>recipe</code>, which implies the presence of different ingredients and sequences of preparation steps.</li>\n<li>Each beverage is being prepared on some physical <code>coffee machine</code>, occupying some position in space.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Every level presents a developer-facing ‘facet’ in our API. While elaborating on the hierarchy of abstractions, we are first of all trying to reduce the interconnectivity of different entities. That would help us to reach several goals.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Simplifying developers' work and the learning curve. At each moment of time, a developer is operating only those entities which are necessary for the task they're solving right now. And conversely, badly designed isolation leads to the situation when developers have to keep in mind lots of concepts mostly unrelated to the task being solved.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Preserving backwards compatibility. Properly separated abstraction levels allow for adding new functionality while keeping interfaces intact.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Maintaining interoperability. Properly isolated low-level abstractions help us to adapt the API to different platforms and technologies without changing high-level entities.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Let's say we have the following interface:</p>\n<pre><code>// Returns lungo recipe\r\nGET /v1/recipes/lungo\n</code></pre>\n<pre><code>// Posts an order to make a lungo\r\n// using specified coffee-machine,\r\n// and returns an order identifier\r\nPOST /v1/orders\r\n{\r\n  \"coffee_machine_id\",\r\n  \"recipe\": \"lungo\"\r\n}\n</code></pre>\n<pre><code>// Returns order state\r\nGET /v1/orders/{id}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Let's consider the question: how exactly developers should determine whether the order is ready or not? Let's say we do the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>add a reference beverage volume to the lungo recipe;</li>\n<li>add the currently prepared volume of beverage to the order state.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Then a developer just needs to compare two numbers to find out whether the order is ready.</p>\n<p>This solution intuitively looks bad, and it really is: it violates all the abovementioned principles.</p>\n<p><strong>First</strong>, to solve the task ‘order a lungo’ a developer needs to refer to the ‘recipe’ entity and learn that every recipe has an associated volume. Then they need to embrace the concept that an order is ready at that particular moment when the prepared beverage volume becomes equal to the reference one. This concept is simply unguessable, and knowing it is mostly useless.</p>\n<p><strong>Second</strong>, we will have automatically got problems if we need to vary the beverage size. For example, if one day we decide to offer a choice to a customer, how many milliliters of lungo they desire exactly, then we have to perform one of the following tricks.</p>\n<p>Variant I: we have a list of possible volumes fixed and introduce bogus recipes like <code>/recipes/small-lungo</code> or <code>recipes/large-lungo</code>. Why ‘bogus’? Because it's still the same lungo recipe, same ingredients, same preparation steps, only volumes differ. We will have to start the mass production of recipes, only different in volume, or introduce some recipe ‘inheritance’ to be able to specify the ‘base’ recipe and just redefine the volume.</p>\n<p>Variant II: we modify an interface, pronouncing volumes stated in recipes being just the default values. We allow requesting different cup volumes while placing an order:</p>\n<pre><code>POST /v1/orders\r\n{\r\n  \"coffee_machine_id\",\r\n  \"recipe\":\"lungo\",\r\n  \"volume\":\"800ml\"\r\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>For those orders with an arbitrary volume requested, a developer will need to obtain the requested volume not from the <code>GET /v1/recipes</code> endpoint, but the <code>GET /v1/orders</code> one. Doing so we're getting a whole bunch of related problems:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>there is a significant chance that developers will make mistakes in this functionality implementation if they add arbitrary volume support in the code working with the <code>POST /v1/orders</code> handler, but forget to make corresponding changes in the order readiness check code;</li>\n<li>the same field (coffee volume) now means different things in different interfaces. In the <code>GET /v1/recipes</code> context the <code>volume</code> field means ‘a volume to be prepared if no arbitrary volume is specified in the <code>POST /v1/orders</code> request’; and it cannot be renamed to ‘default volume’ easily, we now have to live with that.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Third</strong>, the entire scheme becomes totally inoperable if different types of coffee machines produce different volumes of lungo. To introduce the ‘lungo volume depends on machine type’ constraint we have to do quite a nasty thing: make recipes depend on coffee machine ids. By doing so we start actively ‘stir’ abstraction levels: one part of our API (recipe endpoints) becomes unusable without explicit knowledge of another part (coffee machines listing). And what is even worse, developers will have to change the logic of their apps: previously it was possible to choose volume first, then a coffee machine; but now this step must be rebuilt from scratch.</p>\n<p>Okay, we understood how to make things naughty. But how to make them <em>nice</em>?</p>\n<p>Abstraction levels separation should go in three directions:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>From user scenarios to their internal representation: high-level entities and their method nomenclature must directly reflect API usage scenarios; low-level entities reflect the decomposition of scenarios into smaller parts.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>From user subject field terms to ‘raw’ data subject field terms — in our case from high-level terms like ‘order’, ‘recipe’, ‘café’ to low-level terms like ‘beverage temperature’, ‘coffee machine geographical coordinates’, etc.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Finally, from data structures suitable for end users to ‘raw’ data structures — in our case, from ‘lungo recipe’ and ‘\"Chamomile\" café chain’ to the raw byte data stream from ‘Good Morning’ coffee machine sensors.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The more is the distance between programmable contexts our API connects, the deeper is the hierarchy of the entities we are to develop.</p>\n<p>In our example with coffee readiness detection we clearly face the situation when we need an interim abstraction level:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>from one side, an ‘order’ should not store the data regarding coffee machine sensors;</li>\n<li>on the other side, a coffee machine should not store the data regarding order properties (and its API probably doesn't provide such functionality).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A naïve approach to this situation is to design an interim abstraction level as a ‘connecting link’, which reformulates tasks from one abstraction level to another. For example, introduce a <code>task</code> entity like that:</p>\n<pre><code>{\r\n  …\r\n  \"volume_requested\": \"800ml\",\r\n  \"volume_prepared\": \"200ml\",\r\n  \"readiness_policy\": \"check_volume\",\r\n  \"ready\": false,\r\n  \"operation_state\": {\r\n    \"status\": \"executing\",\r\n    \"operations\": [\r\n      // description of commands\r\n      // being executed on \r\n      // a physical coffee machine\r\n    ]\r\n  }\r\n  …\r\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>We call this approach ‘naïve’ not because it's wrong; on the contrary, that's quite a logical ‘default’ solution if you don't know yet (or don't understand yet) how your API will look like. The problem with this approach lies in its speculativeness: it doesn't reflect the subject area's organization.</p>\n<p>An experienced developer in this case must ask: what options do exist? How we really should determine beverage readiness? If it turns out that comparing volumes <em>is</em> the only working method to tell whether the beverage is ready, then all the speculations above are wrong. You may safely include readiness-by-volume detection into your interfaces since no other methods exist. Before abstracting something we need to learn what exactly we're abstracting.</p>\n<p>In our example let's assume that we have studied coffee machines' API specs, and learned that two device types exist:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>coffee machines capable of executing programs coded in the firmware; the only customizable options are some beverage parameters, like desired volume, a syrup flavor, and a kind of milk;</li>\n<li>coffee machines with built-in functions, like ‘grind specified coffee volume’, ‘shed the specified amount of water’, etc.; such coffee machines lack ‘preparation programs’, but provide access to commands and sensors.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To be more specific, let's assume those two kinds of coffee machines provide the following physical API.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Coffee machines with prebuilt programs:</p>\n<pre><code>// Returns a list of programs\r\nGET /programs\r\n→\r\n{\r\n  // program identifier\r\n  \"program\": 1,\r\n  // coffee type\r\n  \"type\": \"lungo\"\r\n}\n</code></pre>\n<pre><code>// Starts an execution \r\n// of a specified program\r\n// and returns execution status\r\nPOST /execute\r\n{\r\n  \"program\": 1,\r\n  \"volume\": \"200ml\"\r\n}\r\n→\r\n{\r\n  // Unique identifier of the execution\r\n  \"execution_id\": \"01-01\",\r\n  // Identifier of the program\r\n  \"program\": 1,\r\n  // Beverage volume requested\r\n  \"volume\": \"200ml\"\r\n}\n</code></pre>\n<pre><code>// Cancels current program\r\nPOST /cancel\n</code></pre>\n<pre><code>// Returns execution status.\r\n// The format is the same \r\n// as in the `POST /execute` method\r\nGET /execution/status\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>NB</strong>. Just in case: this API violates a number of design principles, starting with a lack of versioning; it's described in such a manner because of two reasons: (1) to demonstrate how to design a more convenient API, (2) in the real life, you would really get something like that from vendors, and this API is actually quite a sane one.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Coffee machines with built-in functions:</p>\n<pre><code>// Returns a list of functions available\r\nGET /functions\r\n→\r\n{\r\n  \"functions\": [\r\n    {\r\n      // Operation type:\r\n      // * set_cup\r\n      // * grind_coffee\r\n      // * pour_water\r\n      // * discard_cup\r\n      \"type\": \"set_cup\",\r\n      // Arguments available \r\n      // to each operation.\r\n      // To keep it simple, \r\n      // let's limit these to one:\r\n      // * volume \r\n      //    — a volume of a cup, \r\n      //      coffee, or water\r\n      \"arguments\": [\"volume\"]\r\n    },\r\n    …\r\n  ]\r\n}\n</code></pre>\n<pre><code>// Takes arguments values\r\n// and starts executing a function\r\nPOST /functions\r\n{\r\n  \"type\": \"set_cup\",\r\n  \"arguments\": [{ \r\n    \"name\": \"volume\", \r\n    \"value\": \"300ml\" \r\n  }]\r\n}\n</code></pre>\n<pre><code>// Returns sensors' state\r\nGET /sensors\r\n→\r\n{\r\n  \"sensors\": [\r\n    {\r\n      // Values allowed:\r\n      // * cup_volume\r\n      // * ground_coffee_volume\r\n      // * cup_filled_volume\r\n      \"type\": \"cup_volume\",\r\n      \"value\": \"200ml\"\r\n    },\r\n    …\r\n  ]\r\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>NB</strong>. The example is intentionally factitious to model a situation described above: to determine beverage readiness you have to compare the requested volume with volume sensor readings.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Now the picture becomes more apparent: we need to abstract coffee machine API calls so that the ‘execution level’ in our API provides general functions (like beverage readiness detection) in a unified form. We should also note that these two coffee machine API kinds belong to different abstraction levels themselves: the first one provides a higher-level API than the second one. Therefore, a ‘branch’ of our API working with second-kind machines will be more intricate.</p>\n<p>The next step in abstraction level separating is determining what functionality we're abstracting. To do so we need to understand the tasks developers solve at the ‘order’ level, and to learn what problems they get if our interim level is missing.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Obviously, the developers desire to create an order uniformly: list high-level order properties (beverage kind, volume, and special options like syrup or milk type), and don't think about how the specific coffee machine executes it.</li>\n<li>Developers must be able to learn the execution state: is the order ready? if not — when to expect it's ready (and is there any sense to wait in case of execution errors).</li>\n<li>Developers need to address the order's location in space and time — to explain to users where and when they should pick the order up.</li>\n<li>Finally, developers need to run atomic operations, like canceling orders.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Note, that the first-kind API is much closer to developers' needs than the second-kind API. An indivisible ‘program’ is a way more convenient concept than working with raw commands and sensor data. There are only two problems we see in the first-kind API:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>absence of explicit ‘programs’ to ‘recipes’ relation; program identifier is of no use to developers since there is a ‘recipe’ concept;</li>\n<li>absence of explicit ‘ready’ status.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>But with the second-kind API, it's much worse. The main problem we foresee is an absence of ‘memory’ for actions being executed. Functions and sensors API is totally stateless, which means we don't even understand who called a function being currently executed, when, and which order it relates.</p>\n<p>So we need to introduce two abstraction levels.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Execution control level, which provides the uniform interface to indivisible programs. ‘Uniform interface’ means here that, regardless of a coffee machine's kind, developers may expect:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>statuses and other high-level execution parameters nomenclature (for example, estimated preparation time or possible execution error) being the same;</li>\n<li>methods nomenclature (for example, order cancellation method) and their behavior being the same.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Program runtime level. For the first-kind API, it will provide just a wrapper for existing programs API; for the second-kind API, the entire ‘runtime’ concept is to be developed from scratch by us.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>What does this mean in a practical sense? Developers will still be creating orders, dealing with high-level entities only:</p>\n<pre><code>POST /v1/orders\r\n{\r\n  \"coffee_machin\r\n  \"recipe\": \"lungo\",\r\n  \"volume\": \"800ml\"\r\n}\r\n→\r\n{ \"order_id\" }\n</code></pre>\n<p>The <code>POST /orders</code> handler checks all order parameters, puts a hold of the corresponding sum on the user's credit card, forms a request to run, and calls the execution level. First, a correct execution program needs to be fetched:</p>\n<pre><code>POST /v1/program-matcher\r\n{ \"recipe\", \"coffee-machine\" }\r\n→\r\n{ \"program_id\" }\n</code></pre>\n<p>Now, after obtaining a correct <code>program</code> identifier, the handler runs a program:</p>\n<pre><code>POST /v1/programs/{id}/run\r\n{\r\n  \"order_id\",\r\n  \"coffee_machine_id\",\r\n  \"parameters\": [\r\n    {\r\n      \"name\": \"volume\",\r\n      \"value\": \"800ml\"\r\n    }\r\n  ]\r\n}\r\n→\r\n{ \"program_run_id\" }\n</code></pre>\n<p>Please note that knowing the coffee machine API kind isn't required at all; that's why we're making abstractions! We could possibly make interfaces more specific, implementing different <code>run</code> and <code>match</code> endpoints for different coffee machines:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>POST /v1/program-matcher/{api_type}</code></li>\n<li><code>POST /v1/{api_type}/programs/{id}/run</code></li>\n</ul>\n<p>This approach has some benefits, like the possibility to provide different sets of parameters, specific to the API kind. But we see no need for such fragmentation. <code>run</code> method handler is capable of extracting all the program metadata and performing one of two actions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>call <code>POST /execute</code> physical API method, passing internal program identifier — for the first API kind;</li>\n<li>initiate runtime creation to proceed with the second API kind.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Out of general concerns runtime level for the second-kind API will be private, so we are more or less free in implementing it. The easiest solution would be to develop a virtual state machine that creates a ‘runtime’ (e.g. a stateful execution context) to run a program and control its state.</p>\n<pre><code>POST /v1/runtimes\r\n{ \r\n  \"coffee_machine\", \r\n  \"program\", \r\n  \"parameters\" \r\n}\r\n→\r\n{ \"runtime_id\", \"state\" }\n</code></pre>\n<p>The <code>program</code> here would look like that:</p>\n<pre><code>{\r\n  \"program_id\",\r\n  \"api_type\",\r\n  \"commands\": [\r\n    {\r\n      \"sequence_id\",\r\n      \"type\": \"set_cup\",\r\n      \"parameters\"\r\n    },\r\n    …\r\n  ]\r\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>And the <code>state</code> like that:</p>\n<pre><code>{\r\n  // Runtime status:\r\n  // * \"pending\" — awaiting execution\r\n  // * \"executing\" — performing some command\r\n  // * \"ready_waiting\" — beverage is ready\r\n  // * \"finished\" — all operations done\r\n  \"status\": \"ready_waiting\",\r\n  // Command being currently executed.\r\n  // Similar to line numbers \r\n  // in computer programs\r\n  \"command_sequence_id\",\r\n  // How the execution concluded:\r\n  // * \"success\" \r\n  //     — beverage prepared and taken\r\n  // * \"terminated\" \r\n  //     — execution aborted\r\n  // * \"technical_error\" \r\n  //     — preparation error\r\n  // * \"waiting_time_exceeded\" \r\n  //     — beverage prepared,\r\n  //       but not taken; \r\n  //       timed out then disposed\r\n  \"resolution\": \"success\",\r\n  // All variables values,\r\n  // including sensors state\r\n  \"variables\"\r\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>NB</strong>: while implementing the <code>orders</code> → <code>match</code> → <code>run</code> → <code>runtimes</code> call sequence we have two options:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>either <code>POST /orders</code> handler requests the data regarding the recipe, the coffee machine model, and the program on its own behalf, and forms a stateless request which contains all the necessary data (the API kind, command sequence, etc.);</li>\n<li>or the request contains only data identifiers, and the next handler in the chain will request pieces of data it needs via some internal APIs.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Both variants are plausible, selecting one of them depends on implementation details.</p>\n<h4>Abstraction Levels Isolation</h4>\n<p>A crucial quality of properly separated abstraction levels (and therefore a requirement to their design) is a level isolation restriction: <strong>only adjacent levels may interact</strong>. If ‘jumping over’ is needed in the API design, then clearly mistakes were made.</p>\n<p>Get back to our example. How retrieving order status would work? To obtain a status the following call chain is to be performed:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>a user initiates a call to the <code>GET /v1/orders</code> method;</li>\n<li>the <code>orders</code> handler completes operations on its level of responsibility (for example, checks user authorization), finds <code>program_run_id</code> identifier and performs a call to the <code>runs/{program_run_id}</code> endpoint;</li>\n<li>the <code>runs</code> endpoint in its turn completes operations corresponding to its level (for example, checks the coffee machine API kind) and, depending on the API kind, proceeds with one of two possible execution branches:\n<ul>\n<li>either calls the <code>GET /execution/status</code> method of a physical coffee machine API, gets the coffee volume, and compares it to the reference value;</li>\n<li>or invokes the <code>GET /v1/runtimes/{runtime_id}</code> method to obtain the <code>state.status</code> and converts it to the order status;</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>in the case of the second-kind API, the call chain continues: the <code>GET /runtimes</code> handler invokes the <code>GET /sensors</code> method of a physical coffee machine API and performs some manipulations with the data, like comparing the cup / ground coffee / shed water volumes with the reference ones, and changing the state and the status if needed.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>NB</strong>: The ‘call chain’ wording shouldn't be treated literally. Each abstraction level might be organized differently in a technical sense:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>there might be explicit proxying of calls down the hierarchy;</li>\n<li>there might be a cache at each level, being updated upon receiving a callback call or an event. In particular, a low-level runtime execution cycle obviously must be independent of upper levels, renew its state in the background, and not wait for an explicit call.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Note what happens here: each abstraction level wields its own status (e.g. order, runtime, sensors status), being formulated in subject area terms corresponding to this level. Forbidding the ‘jumping over’ results in the necessity to spawn statuses at each level independently.</p>\n<p>Let's now look at how the order cancel operation flows through our abstraction levels. In this case, the call chain will look like that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>a user initiates a call to the <code>POST /v1/orders/{id}/cancel</code> method;</li>\n<li>the method handler completes operations on its level of responsibility:\n<ul>\n<li>checks the authorization;</li>\n<li>solves money issues, i.e. whether a refund is needed;</li>\n<li>finds the <code>program_run_id</code> identifier and calls the <code>runs/{program_run_id}/cancel</code> method;</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>the <code>runs/cancel</code> handler completes operations on its level of responsibility and, depending on the coffee machine API kind, proceeds with one of two possible execution branches:\n<ul>\n<li>either calls the <code>POST /execution/cancel</code> method of a physical coffee machine API;</li>\n<li>or invokes the <code>POST /v1/runtimes/{id}/terminate</code> method;</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>in a second case the call chain continues as the <code>terminate</code> handler operates its internal state:\n<ul>\n<li>changes the <code>resolution</code> to <code>\"terminated\"</code>;</li>\n<li>runs the <code>\"discard_cup\"</code> command.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Handling state-modifying operations like the <code>cancel</code> one requires more advanced abstraction levels juggling skills compared to non-modifying calls like the <code>GET /status</code> one. There are two important moments:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>At each abstraction level the idea of ‘order canceling’ is reformulated:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>at the <code>orders</code> level, this action in fact splits into several ‘cancels’ of other levels: you need to cancel money holding and to cancel an order execution;</li>\n<li>at the second API kind, physical level the ‘cancel’ operation itself doesn't exist: ‘cancel’ means ‘executing the <code>discard_cup</code> command’, which is quite the same as any other command.\r\nThe interim API level is needed to make this transition between different level ‘cancels’ smooth and rational without jumping over canyons.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>From a high-level point of view, canceling an order is a terminal action, since no further operations are possible. From a low-level point of view, the processing continues until the cup is discarded, and then the machine is to be unlocked (e.g. new runtimes creation allowed). It's a task to the execution control level to couple those two states, outer (the order is canceled) and inner (the execution continues).</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>It might look that forcing the abstraction levels isolation is redundant and makes interfaces more complicated. In fact, it is: it's very important to understand that flexibility, consistency, readability, and extensibility come with a price. One may construct an API with zero overhead, essentially just providing access to the coffee machine's microcontrollers. However using such an API would be a disaster for a developer, not to mention the inability to extend it.</p>\n<p>Separating abstraction levels is first of all a logical procedure: how we explain to ourselves and developers what our API consists of. <strong>The abstraction gap between entities exists objectively</strong>, no matter what interfaces we design. Our task is just separate this gap into levels <em>explicitly</em>. The more implicitly abstraction levels are separated (or worse — blended into each other), the more complicated is your API's learning curve, and the worse is the code that uses it.</p>\n<h4>The Data Flow</h4>\n<p>One useful exercise allowing us to examine the entire abstraction hierarchy is excluding all the particulars and constructing (on a paper or just in your head) a data flow chart: what data is flowing through your API entities, and how it's being altered at each step.</p>\n<p>This exercise doesn't just help but also allows to design really large APIs with huge entity nomenclatures. Human memory isn't boundless; any project which grows extensively will eventually become too big to keep the entire entity hierarchy in mind. But it's usually possible to keep in mind the data flow chart, or at least keep a much larger portion of the hierarchy.</p>\n<p>What data flow do we have in our coffee API?</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>It starts with the sensors data, i.e. volumes of coffee / water / cups. This is the lowest data level we have, and here we can't change anything.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>A continuous sensors data stream is being transformed into discrete command execution statuses, injecting new concepts which don't exist within the subject area. A coffee machine API doesn't provide a ‘coffee is being shed’ or a ‘cup is being set’ notion. It's our software that treats incoming sensors data and introduces new terms: if the volume of coffee or water is less than the target one, then the process isn't over yet. If the target value is reached, then this synthetic status is to be switched, and the next command to be executed.<br>\nIt is important to note that we don't calculate new variables out from sensors data: we need to create a new dataset first, a context, an ‘execution program’ comprising a sequence of steps and conditions, and to fill it with initial values. If this context is missing, it's impossible to understand what's happening with the machine.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Having logical data about the program execution state, we can (again via creating a new high-level data context) merge two different data streams from two different kinds of APIs into a single stream, which provides in a unified form the data regarding executing a beverage preparation program with logical variables like the recipe, volume, and readiness status.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Each API abstraction level, therefore corresponds to some data flow generalization and enrichment, converting the low-level (and in fact useless to end users) context terms into the higher-level context terms.</p>\n<p>We may also traverse the tree backward.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>At the order level, we set its logical parameters: recipe, volume, execution place and possible statuses set.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>At the execution level, we read the order level data and create a lower level execution context: the program as a sequence of steps, their parameters, transition rules, and initial state.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>At the runtime level, we read the target parameters (which operation to execute, and what the target volume is) and translate them into coffee machine API microcommands and statuses for each command.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Also, if we take a deeper look into the ‘bad’ decision (forcing developers to determine actual order status on their own), being discussed at the beginning of this chapter, we could notice a data flow collision there:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>from one side, in the order context ‘leaked’ physical data (beverage volume prepared) is injected, therefore stirring abstraction levels irreversibly;</li>\n<li>from the other side, the order context itself is deficient: it doesn't provide new meta-variables, non-existent at the lower levels (the order status, in particular), doesn't initialize them, and doesn't set the game rules.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We will discuss data contexts in more detail in Section II. Here we will just state that data flows and their transformations might be and must be examined as a specific API facet, which, from one side, helps us to separate abstraction levels properly, and, from the other side, to check if our theoretical structures work as intended.</p>"}
